There are six activities that make up the ADLs: feeding, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring in and out of bed and mobility. Almost 4 million adults living in households need help from someone for at least one ADL. Most of the patients you visit require some assistance with one or more of their ADLs. Some of them need less assistance and some are totally dependent. Some of your patients will never be able to be any more independent than they are, but most of your patients can improve in their abilities to perform ADLs"

//       text: "People who have lost the ability to perform ADLs are at a much greater risk of hospitalization, nursing home placement and death than other people the same age who are independent. The percentage of people needing help with ADLs is very high among elderly homecare patients. The most frequently reported ADL limitation is bathing."
//     },

//       text: "There are many reasons that people receiving homecare need assistance with their ADLs. Generally speaking, patients need help performing ADLs for one of three reasons: (1) paralysis or loss of physical function, (2) weakness or decreased endurance due to disease process or surgery and (3) confusion or cognitive disorders. Some of the more common reasons you will see in homecare patients include:"

//       text: "Fractures, casts. The presence of a cast on one’s arm or leg can make it very difficult for a person to bathe him or herself or perform other ADLs without assistance. Many of these patients will also improve and when the casts are removed, they will once again be independent."
//     },
//     {
//       text: "Strokes. Many patients have some degree of extremity paralysis or weakness following a stroke. If the stroke is recent, the patient may be able to make a lot of progress in his or her ability to perform ADLs. However, if the stroke occurred a long time ago and the patient has had extensive therapy and has been using assistive equipment, then he or she may not have any further improvement and will never be independent."

//       text: "Heart disease or chronic lung disease. These patients may have such difficulty breathing that they need assistance in ADLs. For most of these patients, performing ADLSs takes a much longer time than normal because they must rest often during activity. With better control of their symptoms, they may improve in their abilities to perform ADLs but may continue to require some assistance."
//     }, 
//     {
//       text: "Severe arthritis. The joint stiffness and deformities of severe arthritis make it harder for these patients to perform ADLS. They may also have a great deal of pain. However, many of them may be able to show improvement if they have devices to assist them and learn different methods of bathing and dressing."

//       text: "Neurological disease. Depending on the severity and involvement of the disease, patients with neurological diseases may require assistance with ADLs. In some cases (like multiple sclerosis),the diseases have periods of remission and the patient’s symptoms improve and they require less assistance. In other cases (like Alzheimer’s disease), the disease progressively worsens and the patients will not improve in their abilities to perform ADLs."

//       text: "There are many things that home health aides can do to help patients improve their performance of ADLs. The key to success lies in good communication with the nurse or therapist who is seeing the patient. In addition to carefully reviewing the assignment sheet, you should talk with the nurse or therapist about how much the patient can be expected to improve and how you can best help. It is important for you to know whether the patient has already reached maximum level of functioning or whether the patient may be able to do more. It takes a team effort with the patient and family, the nurse or therapist and you to help the patient improve in performing ADLs. Some areas in which you may help include:"
