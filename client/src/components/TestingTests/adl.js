        <b>Activities of Daily Living and Your Role</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Activities of daily living (often called ADLs) are basic self-care
        activities that are considered essential for day-to-day living. There
        are six activities that make up the ADLs: feeding, bathing, dressing,
        toileting, transferring in and out of bed and mobility. Almost 4 million
        adults living in households need help from someone for at least one ADL.
        Most of the patients you visit require some assistance with one or more
        of their ADLs. Some of them need less assistance and some are totally
        dependent. Some of your patients will never be able to be any more
        independent than they are, but most of your patients can improve in
        their abilities to perform ADLs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        People who have lost the ability to perform ADLs are at a much greater
        risk of hospitalization, nursing home placement and death than other
        people the same age who are independent. The percentage of people
        needing help with ADLs is very high among elderly homecare patients. The
        most frequently reported ADL limitation is bathing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many reasons that people receiving homecare need assistance
        with their ADLs. Generally speaking, patients need help performing ADLs
        for one of three reasons: (1) paralysis or loss of physical function,
        (2) weakness or decreased endurance due to disease process or surgery
        and (3) confusion or cognitive disorders. Some of the more common
        reasons you will see in homecare patients include:

      <ul id="l1">
        <li>
          <h3>Recent surgery</h3>
          <p>
            Many times patients have reduced endurance following surgery and are
            not able to perform ADLs. Many of these patients will improve as you
            are caring for them and will become independent in several weeks.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Fractures, casts</h3>
          <p>
            The presence of a cast on one’s arm or leg can make it very
            difficult for a person to bathe him or herself or perform other ADLs
            without assistance. Many of these patients will also improve and
            when the casts are removed, they will once again be independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Strokes</h3>
          <p>
            Many patients have some degree of extremity paralysis or weakness
            following a stroke. If the stroke is recent, the patient may be able
            to make a lot of progress in his or her ability to perform ADLs.
            However, if the stroke occurred a long time ago and the patient has
            had extensive therapy and has been using assistive equipment, then
            he or she may not have any further improvement and will never be
            independent.

        <li>
          <h3>Heart disease or chronic lung disease</h3>
          <p>
            These patients may have such difficulty breathing that they need
            assistance in ADLs. For most of these patients, performing ADLSs
            takes a much longer time than normal because they must rest often
            during activity. With better control of their symptoms, they may
            improve in their abilities to perform ADLs but may continue to
            require some assistance.

        <li>
          <h3>Severe arthritis</h3>
          <p>
            The joint stiffness and deformities of severe arthritis make it
            harder for these patients to perform ADLS. They may also have a
            great deal of pain. However, many of them may be able to show
            improvement if they have devices to assist them and learn different
            methods of bathing and dressing.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Neurological disease</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the severity and involvement of the disease, patients
            with neurological diseases may require assistance with ADLs. In some
            cases (like multiple sclerosis), the diseases have periods of
            remission and the patient’s symptoms improve and they require less
            assistance. In other cases (like Alzheimer’s disease), the disease
            progressively worsens and the patients will not improve in their
            abilities to perform ADLs.

        <li>
          <h3>Cancer or other debilitating diseases such as AIDS</h3>
          <p>
            Whether or not these patients will improve depends upon the extent
            of their diseases and/or responses to treatments. Some patients will
            be able to improve while others will continually decline.

          <p class="s1">HOW DO YOU HELP PATIENTS IMPROVE IN ADLS?</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are many things that home health aides can do to help patients
            improve their performance of ADLs. The key to success lies in good
            communication with the nurse or therapist who is seeing the patient.
            In addition to carefully reviewing the assignment sheet, you should
            talk with the nurse or therapist about how much the patient can be
            expected to improve and how you can best help. It is important for
            you to know whether the patient has already reached maximum level of
            functioning or whether the patient may be able to do more. It takes
            a team effort with the patient and family, the nurse or therapist
            and you to help the patient improve in performing ADLs. Some areas
            in which you may help include:
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Dressing</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Help the patient establish a routine for dressing that follows a
            logical sequence. Help her select and arrange her clothes in the
            order they will be put on.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Encourage the patient to sit while doing most of the dressing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Encourage the patient to choose clothing that is comfortable and
            easy to put on and remove. Elastic waistbands and Velcro closures
            are much easier to use than zippers and buttons. Pull-over shirts or
            sweaters need to have large neck holes to make them easier to get on
            and off. Elastic shoelaces make it easier to put on shoes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the patient has weakness or paralysis of an arm or leg, remind
            him to dress the “weak” arm or leg first.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Learn how to use any dressing aids the patient has. They may use
            buttonhooks, reaching sticks, long-handles shoe spoons or other
            devices. If you think a patient would benefit from having assistive
            devices, discuss this with the nurse.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Always encourage the patient to do as much for herself as possible.
            This may take more time but it is important in helping the patient
            improve in doing for herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Bathing</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Help the patient establish a good time for bathing. This should be a
            time when he is not rushed or tired from other activities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Help the patient organize everything needed for the bath. The type
            of bath she will take will be on the assignment sheet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Never assist the patient into the shower or tub if it cannot be done
            safely. The nurse or therapist should have assessed the safety but
            if the patient needs a bath seat, non-skid mats or grab bars in
            order to be safe, do not put him in the tub without them. Notify the
            supervisor that you do not feel it is safe to bathe him in the tub
            and follow the supervisor’s directions. (Don’t forget to document
            this on the visit report.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Learn how to use any bathing aids the patient may have. She may also
            have grooming aids to help her.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Allow the patient to bathe himself as much as possible.</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Eating</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Help the patient establish a quiet, calm time for eating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Encourage the family to prepare finger foods that may be easier to
            manage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Help the patient and family organize the table so that things are
            within easy reach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Learn to use any assistive devices the patient may have. There are
            numerous aids including utensils with wide handles, swivels or
            straps, non-skid mats to keep plates from sliding, plates with plate
            guards so food can be pushed onto the spoon, special glasses and
            cups. If you think the patient could benefit from such devices, talk
            with the nurse.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Never rush the patient to eat and encourage the family to allow
            plenty of time for meals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Toileting</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If necessary, help the patient establish a bathroom routine. Some
            patients do not have the normal warning time that signals the need
            to urinate. These patients may do well to use the toilet routinely
            every three hours to prevent incontinence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Many patients do better with a raised toilet that makes coming to a
            standing position much easier.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Notify the supervisor if there are structural barriers that keep the
            patient from getting to the toilet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Learn how to use assistive toileting devices. This may include a
            long curved reaching device that allows the patient to wipe herself
            after using the toilet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Transferring in and out of bed</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consult with the nurse or therapist to find out exactly how the
            patient should be assisted with transfers and to what extent he is
            expected to improve. A joint visit with the therapist or nurse can
            be very helpful in establishing a consistent approach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assist the patient as directed on the assignment sheet, allowing the
            patient to participate as much as possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assist the patient with any assigned exercises. These will help
            condition and strengthen the muscles and help the patient become
            more independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Mobility</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Follow the assignment sheet in assisting the patient with ambulation
            or in use of the wheelchair.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Encourage the patient to participate as much as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Give lots or praise and encouragement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Help the patient schedule activities so that there is time for rest
            in between.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Do not be tempted to do everything for the patient. Encourage the
            patient to do as much for himself as possible. While it may seem
            easier and may take less time, doing for the patient will not
            promote independence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Be an advocate for your patient. Don’t be reluctant to talk with the
            supervisor or nurse if you think the patient needs devices to help
            him.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Give lots of praise and encouragement. Point out to the patient how
            much progress she is making. Focus on what she can do, not what she
            cannot do.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Be patient and allow the patient time to participate. Many times the
            task will take much longer when the patient does it for himself.
            Keep in mind that the patient needs to learn to do these things so
            he can manage when he is no longer receiving homecare.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Help the patient to be realistic. If the nurse or therapist tells
            you that the patient will never be able to do a certain task, help
            the patient adjust. Keep in mind that some patients will never be
            independent in ADLs no matter what assistive devices are available.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="s3">
            Carefully document the patient’s progress. Stay in close contact
