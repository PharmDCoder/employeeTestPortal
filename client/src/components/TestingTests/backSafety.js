        It’s Your Back Don’t Break It: Back Safety for Home Care Workers
      </h1>
      <h3>ERGONOMIC HAZARDS</h3>
      <p>
        Many times back pain can be directly traced to the ergonomic hazards of
        your job as a home healthcare worker. What exactly is an ergonomic
        hazard? It is the hazards that you face during your employment related
        to your job duties. As a healthcare provider and during your training
        you were taught your skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        These hazards may include frequent bending, twisting, lifting, pushing,
        pulling and other forceful or repetitive movements. Over time, these
        hazards can cause injuries known as cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs).
        CTDs are caused by repetitive wear and tear on tendons, muscles, related
        nerves and bones. They may show up as pain or injury in the back, neck,
        shoulders, elbows, wrists or hands. We have all heard of one of the most
        common perhaps as an example, like a secretary getting carpal tunnel
        syndrome from typing at the computer over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        All healthcare workers who lift and transfer patients are at great risk
        for back injury. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nurses and
        personal care workers (including home health care workers) have a higher
        incidence of injury on the job than do miners and construction workers.
        In fact, the incidence of injury is more than twice that of miners and
        almost 1.5 times higher than construction workers. These injury rates
        are mainly due to the ergonomic hazards you face when lifting and
        transferring patients. Why do you think that it is so high for health
        care workers? Take a moment a think about the situations that you have
        been in…
      </p>

      <p>
        As a home healthcare worker, your risk for back injury is even greater
        due to repeated lifting and transferring of patients in the home
        environment. You are at additional risk because you are usually working
        on your own. When you lift or transfer a patient, the risk of injury to
        your body is caused by:
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-1 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          The mechanical stress of the lift, the actual strain that is put on
          your back.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Poor body mechanics, poor body trunk positioning.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          The unpredictable movements of patients
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">An awkward or crowded space </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite all these risks, you can protect your back by following some
        simple safety principles and by using common sense. Your body is built
        to sustain big work loads, if you use your body safely. Remember to:
      </p>

      <ul className="materials-ul-2 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Maintain good body posture</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Use safe body mechanics</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Use protective lifting devices</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          ACT safely during the lift and transfer
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Keep physically fit</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Proper Posture</h3>
      <p>
        Maintaining proper posture puts the vertebrae and the surrounding
        muscles in the best position to do work safely. Your vertebrae are
        naturally aligned with a gentle curve inward at the neck (cervical
        area), a curve outward at the chest (thoracic area) and another curve
        inward at the lower back (lumbar area). To align your posture, take this
        stance: head up, shoulders back, chest out, stomach in, buttocks tucked.
        Now, tense your body muscles, and then relax them with some shaking
        motions. Finally, let your body adjust to a neutral position. The
        neutral position is the safest position for your body during work.
      </p>

      <h3>Safe Body Mechanics</h3>
      <ul className="materials-ul-2 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Keep a safe, neutral position during work.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Bend at your hips and knees, not at the waist{" "}
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Keep loads close to your body. If you lift 50 pounds with your arms
          away from your body, the force of the load on your back will equal 500
          pounds.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          During the lift, contract your stomach muscles to protect your back.
          Use the force of your leg muscles to do the work – not your back and
          arms.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Avoid twisting motions. They misalign your back and increase the risk
          of injury. Instead, take small steps and pivot.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Avoid overreaching, whether up, down or across. Use a step stool to
          reach something high. Organize materials ahead of time for easy
          access.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Don’t lift objects placed above shoulder height or below the waist.
          Raise or lower yourself before lifting them, or place the objects to
          be lifted at the safe height
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Always keep your working surface slightly higher than waist level to
          avoid back strain.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Don’t lift a load that is too heavy for you by yourself. Find a way to
          lighten the load or arrange for a partner to help you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Protective Devices for Lifting</h3>
      <p>
        Using patient transferring devices has been shown to greatly relieve
        lower back stress and reduce worker injury by:{" "}
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Eliminating manual lifting and transfers
        </li>

        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Reducing the number of patient transfers needed per task

          Eliminating manual transfers in a confined workspace such as a
          bathroom
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Protective devices include:</p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Transfer belts</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Hoyer Lifts</li>

        <li className="materials-improve-li">Repositioning devices</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Weighing devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Safe Lifting and Transferring </h3>
      <p>
        Because lifting and transferring patients pose the greatest ergonomic
        threat for home healthcare workers, learn to ACT safely:
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Assess</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Create</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Transfer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assess the situation for Hazards before you begin.</p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Identify hazards like crowded areas, very heavy loads and situations
          where special lifting assists are needed
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Observe the patient’s size, health condition, hearing or visual
          limitations and his or her ability to help. A patient’s assistance can
          make the difference between a manageable load and a hazardous load.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Talk the patient through all lifts and transfers. This helps the
          patient to feel less anxious and to cooperate with you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Create a safe workplace.</p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Create a big enough space for safely lifting and transferring the
          patient. Decrease clutter. Move furniture out of the way.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Organize your space so everything you will need is accessible. Place
          equipment where it can be reached easily.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Make sure the bed and chairs are stable before you begin lifting so
          that you avoid unpredictable movement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        As you probably know, keeping your body fit is one of the best things
        you can do to protect your back. Strong muscles, limber joints and
        overall fitness can keep you from hurting your back. To keep fit, follow
        an exercise program that includes:
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Aerobic activity for at least 20 minutes 3 times per week
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Muscle strengthening exercises</li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Flexibility exercises</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Aerobic Activity</h5>
      <p>
        Brisk walking is excellent for your back. Swimming is also good if you
        avoid taking strokes early in your training that can injure your back,
        such as the breast stroke and butterfly. Check with your doctor before
        starting a program, especially if you have back problems.
      </p>
      <h5>Strength</h5>
      <p>
        Exercises that focus on strengthening your upper body, abdomen, pelvis
        and thighs will help to protect your more vulnerable back muscles. Using
        a weight circuit that isolates the muscle groups is an excellent method
        for strengthening your body. Make sure you breathe in and out evenly
        while exercising, keep your body in a neutral posture and repeat each
        exercise 8-10 times per set, working up to three sets per session.
      </p>
      <h5>Arms</h5>
      <p>
        Starting with arms straight out to the side at shoulder height, do the
        following exercises:
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Make small circles with your arms
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Bend your elbows and bring your fists to your shoulders
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Bring your arms and hands together in front of you at chest height,
          bend your elbows, and lift elbows and arms straight up in front of you
          for several inches and then bring down to chest level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Abdomen</h5>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Lie on the floor with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor,
          your arms bent at the elbows and your hands on either side of your
          head
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Raise straight upward from your shoulders, keeping your head parallel
          to the floor so that you are looking straight up at the ceiling. Keep
          your lower back against the floor.
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Lower to your original position. Repeat with legs straight up in the
          air, hips, bent at a 90 degree angle from the floor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Legs</h5>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Stand with back flat against the wall and feet about one foot from the
          wall
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Slowly sink down to a 45 degree angle
        </li>
        <li className="materials-improve-li">
          Hold 10-15 seconds, then slowly slide back up
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Flexibility</h5>
      <p>
        Increase the flexibility of your back from the cervical to the lumbar
        areas with the following exercises:
      </p>
      <ul className="materials-ul-3 text-left">
        <li className="materials-improve-li">Neck</li>
        <ul className="text-left">
          <li>
            Stand in a neutral posture, with your head facing straight forward
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn your head to one side and hold before returning to start –
            repeat on other side
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring one ear toward shoulder and hold before returning to start –
            repeat on other aside
          </li>
          <li>
            With two fingers, tuck chin toward chest and hold before returning

          <li>
            Bring one bent knee into your chest with gentle pressure from your
            hands clasped behind your knee. Hold for 8-10 seconds before
            returning to start
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat with other leg. Then repeat with both knees pressed toward
            chest and hold before returning to start
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Protect Yourself from Hazards</h3>
      <p>
        You can protect both yourself and your patient by evaluating the
        patient’s home for ergonomic hazards, assessing the patient’s specific
        handling needs and developing a plan to safely handle that patient. You
        can suggest changes in the home but you can’t demand them. Not all
        patients agree to move furniture in order to make space more workable,
        and some houses are too small to get furniture out of the way. You will
        need to devise methods of lifting and transferring when conditions are
        not the best. Use lifting devices to help you. Use a transfer belt for
        difficult transfers. Encourage the installation of trapeze bars and
        safety bars to help protect you and the patient. Don’t lift anything too
        heavy by yourself. If you can’t lighten the load, arrange for a partner
        to help you.
      </p>
      <h5>Remember:</h5>
      <p>
        Patients can fall unexpectedly for any number of reasons. If a patient
        starts to fall, don’t try to stop the fall. Grasp the patient and,
        getting as close as you can, guide the patient gently to the floor by
        bending your hips and knees. If necessary, get help to lift the patient
        from the floor.
