      <h1>Activities of Daily Living and Your Role</h1>
      <h3>FACTS</h3>
      <p>
        Activities of daily living - often called ADLs - are basic self-care
        activities that are considered essential for day-to-day living. There
        are six activities that make up the ADLs: feeding, bathing, dressing,
        toileting, transferring in and out of bed and mobility. Almost 4 million
        adults living in households need help from someone for at least one ADL.
        Most of the patients you visit require some assistance with one or more
        of their ADLs. Some of them need less assistance and some are totally
        dependent. Some of your patients will never be able to be any more
        independent than they are, but most of your patients can improve in
        their abilities to perform ADLs.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who have lost the ability to perform ADLs are at a much greater
        risk of hospitalization, nursing home placement and death than other
        people the same age who are independent. The percentage of people
        needing help with ADLs is very high among elderly homecare patients. The
        most frequently reported ADL limitation is bathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many reasons that people receiving homecare need assistance
        with their ADLs. Generally speaking, patients need help performing ADLs
        for one of three reasons: 1. paralysis or loss of physical function, 2.
        weakness or decreased endurance due to disease process or surgery and 3.
        confusion or cognitive disorders. Some of the more common reasons you
        will see in homecare patients include:
      </p>
      <ul className="adl-ul-1 text-left">
        <li>Recent Surgery</li>
        <p>
          Many times patients have reduced endurance following surgery and are
          not able to perform ADLs. Many of these patients will improve as you
          are caring for them and will become independent in several weeks.
        </p>
        <li>Fracture, casts</li>
        <p>
          The presence of a cast on one’s arm or leg can make it very difficult
          for a person to bathe him or herself or perform other ADLs without
          assistance. Many of these patients will also improve and when the
          casts are removed, they will once again be independent.
        </p>
        <li>Strokes</li>
        <p>
          Many patients have some degree of extremity paralysis or weakness
          following a stroke. If the stroke is recent, the patient may be able
          to make a lot of progress in his or her ability to perform ADLs.
          However, if the stroke occurred a long time ago and the patient has
          had extensive therapy and has been using assistive equipment, then he
          or she may not have any further improvement and will never be
          independent.
        </p>
        <li>Heart diseae or chronic lung disease</li>
        <p>
          These patients may have such difficulty breathing that they need
          assistance in ADLs. For most of these patients, performing ADLSs takes
          a much longer time than normal because they must rest often during
          activity. With better control of their symptoms, they may improve in
          their abilities to perform ADLs but may continue to require some
          assistance.
        </p>
        <li>Severe arthritis</li>
        <p>
          The joint stiffness and deformities of severe arthritis make it harder
          for these patients to perform ADLS. They may also have a great deal of
          pain. However, many of them may be able to show improvement if they
          have devices to assist them and learn different methods of bathing and
          dressing.
        </p>
        <li>Neurological disease</li>
        <p>
          Depending on the severity and involvement of the disease, patients
          with neurological diseases may require assistance with ADLs. In some
          cases - like multiple sclerosis, - the diseases have periods of
          remission and the patient’s symptoms improve and they require less
          assistance. In other cases - like Alzheimer’s disease -, the disease
          progressively worsens and the patients will not improve in their
          abilities to perform ADLs.
        </p>
        <li>Cancer or other debilitating diseases such as AIDS</li>
        <p>
          Whether or not these patients will improve depends upon the extent of
          their diseases and/or responses to treatments. Some patients will be
          able to improve while others will continually decline.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>HOW DO YOU HELP PATIENTS IMPROVE IN ADLS?</h3>
      <p>
        There are many things that home health aides can do to help patients
        improve their performance of ADLs. The key to success lies in good
        communication with the nurse or therapist who is seeing the patient. In
        addition to carefully reviewing the assignment sheet, you should talk
        with the nurse or therapist about how much the patient can be expected
        to improve and how you can best help. It is important for you to know
        whether the patient has already reached maximum level of functioning or
        whether the patient may be able to do more. It takes a team effort with
        the patient and family, the nurse or therapist and you to help the
        patient improve in performing ADLs. Some areas in which you may help
        include:
      </p>
      <ul className="adl-ul-2 text-left">
        <li>Dressing</li>
        <ul className="text-left">
          <li>
            Help the patient establish a routine for dressing that follows a
            logical sequence. Help her select and arrange her clothes in the
            order they will be put on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage the patient to sit while doing most of the dressing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage the patient to choose clothing that is comfortable and
            easy to put on and remove. Elastic waistbands and Velcro closures
            are much easier to use than zippers and buttons. Pull-over shirts or
            sweaters need to have large neck holes to make them easier to get on
            and off. Elastic shoelaces make it easier to put on shoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the patient has weakness or paralysis of an arm or leg, remind
            him to dress the “weak” arm or leg first.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn how to use any dressing aids the patient has. They may use
            buttonhooks, reaching sticks, long-handles shoe spoons or other
            devices. If you think a patient would benefit from having assistive
            devices, discuss this with the nurse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always encourage the patient to do as much for herself as possible.
            This may take more time but it is important in helping the patient
            improve in doing for herself.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bathing</li>
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>Toileting</li>
        <li>Transferring in and out of bed</li>
        <li>Mobility</li>
      </ul>
