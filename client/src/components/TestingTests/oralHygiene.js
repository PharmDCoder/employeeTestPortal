              liquid known as saliva, which keeps the mouth moist and helps to
              begin the breakdown of food before it is swallowed.

          <p>
            Like other body tissues, tissues in the mouth change as people grow
            older. Gums and cheeks lose their ability to stretch, and muscles
            become soft and weak. The amount of saliva produced by glands in the
            mouth is frequently reduced. As a result, chewing becomes more
            difficult, and the mouth becomes easily irritated and heals slowly.
            For these reasons, special attention to oral hygiene in the elderly
            is more important than ever. Many of the elderly forget or don’t
            want to be bothered caring for their teeth. They may have pain or
            fear associated with oral hygiene. Many of the elderly wear partial
            or complete dentures and for this reason think they don’t have to
            brush and care for their mouths. And, in many cases, older adults
            can’t afford good dental care.

            Oral hygiene in the elderly must not be overlooked. Poor oral
            hygiene can lead to serious health problems and can worsen existing
            health conditions.

              {" "}
              The rate of tooth decay may increase with age especially if the
              amount of saliva is reduced. Tooth decay in older adults appears
              most frequently around the teeth at the level of the gums. The
              lower portions of the teeth contain the roots, which attach the
              teeth to the jawbone. When exposed, the root portion of a tooth is
              especially subject to decay.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Dental cavities may also occur when food particles are trapped
            between teeth. As particles build up, a white residue – plaque – is
            formed on the outer covering of the teeth, known as enamel. This
            plaque may cause the enamel to deteriorate, forming the holes in the
            teeth known as cavities.

              {" "}
              Red or swollen gums that bleed with the slightest irritation are a
              sign of periodontal disease. Pockets often develop between teeth
              and gums and can pack or trap small pieces of food. If not
              treated, the disease becomes more and more destructive. In the
              elderly, periodontal disease is a primary cause for loss of teeth.

            Brittleness and wear of teeth:
            <span class="p">
              {" "}
              As a person ages, teeth have less fluid content and will become
              brittle. Brittle teeth may be easily broken or chipped. Since the
              nerve portion of the tooth is decreased, it’s fortunate that
              little pain is experienced when even severe fractures occur. In
              addition, over time teeth wear down from chewing. Tooth enamel is
              the outer layer of a tooth. It is a hard, thin, translucent layer
              of calcified substance that protects the dentin, which is the main
              portion of the structure of the tooth. The enamel becomes thinner
              from normal processes, such as chewing, sometimes completely
              wearing away. This can expose the dentin, the softer part of the
              tooth. The dentin can easily be dissolved, leaving the tooth
              susceptible to chipping and breakage.

          </p>
          <p>
            Often, the elderly wear a complete or partial, removable denture.
            Dentures can be uncomfortable due to the inability of the remaining
            ridges in the mouth to provide the support necessary to successfully
            wear the denture. After teeth are removed, the remaining bone or
            ridge shrinks. As a result, and over time, the dentures may become
            ill- fitting and uncomfortable for the wearer. Chewing can be
            painful. In addition, the tissue covering the bone becomes thinner
            and is more easily irritated. It is estimated that nearly half of
            the dentures worn by the elderly persons are ill-fitting and
            potentially harmful.

            The occurrence of oral cancers seems to increase with age. Radiation
            therapy used to treat some oral cancers can reduce the amount of
            saliva, which leaves tissues easily irritated and teeth subject to
            rapid decay.

            Diabetes is sometimes accompanied by inflammation and reduced
            healing capacity of the gums. Approximately 95 percent of Americans

            increased potential for infections.

            A common side effect of some medications used to treat heart

            a decrease in the amount of saliva, which results in a very dry
            mouth. An increase in tooth decay, periodontal disease, and an
            inability to tolerate dentures can result.

            Some patients may experience thrush. Thrush is a fungal infection
            that may affect the tongue, teeth, and gums. It often occurs when
            patients are on antibiotics or are receiving chemotherapy for
            various types of cancers. Those strong medicines kill many types of
          </p>
          <p>
            germs, even the common germs that always exist in the mouth. When
            the mouth’s common germs are gone, there’s the opportunity for
            fungus to take over and grow. Patients may experience pain, a thick
            white substance spotting or covering the tongue and teeth, and
            decreased taste and appetite. Thrush is treated with special,
            anti-fungal medication that patients usually swish around in the
            mouth and then spit out.

          <p>
            As is the case with most health-related issues, diet plays an
            extremely important role in keeping the mouth healthy and strong.
            Many older adults have issues that make them less likely to consume
            a healthy diet. For example, changes in chewing ability due to
            denture wear, dry mouth due to medication use, changes in taste,
            physical limitations, missing teeth and untreated tooth decay, and
            ill-fitting dentures can all negatively affect one’s diet. Other
            reasons for a poor diet include isolation, lack of financial
            resources, and depression.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthy eating is especially important for older adults since poor
            nutrition can lead to poor overall health. Once health issues such
            as diseases of the mouth, teeth, and gums set in, a person is less
            likely to maintain a healthy diet and a vicious cycle starts.

            Simple carbohydrates, or sugars, are the biggest contributors to
            tooth decay. Whenever sugar comes in contact with the plaque that
            may be found on the surface of a tooth, bacteria in the plaque
            produce acid. This acid can dissolve the tooth surface and lead to
            tooth decay, cavities, and gum disease. And it’s not only how much
            sugar you eat, but when you eat it. That is, the time sugar stays in
            contact with the teeth is more important than how much sugar is
            eaten. So, nibbling on crackers all day is much more damaging than
            eating a pastry in five minutes, though the pastry could contain
            more sugar. Of special interest is that, through diet colas contain
            no sugar, they do contain acid that can promote tooth decay.

            People who wear dentures may have problems chewing certain foods and
            may lean toward soft diets, which are often high in carbohydrates
            and low in nutritional value. Eating a proper diet is especially
            important for people who wear dentures. As a group, denture wearers
            tend to have lower-quality diets than do people with most or all of
            their natural teeth. Denture wearers may not get enough of certain
            nutrients, such a vitamin B6, vitamin E, and zinc, which are found
            in hard-to-chew foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and meat.

            Accumulation of food debris, plaque, or calculus (hardened plaque)

            There are ways to make brushing teethe easier for elderly patients.
            For example, if the patient has trouble holding a toothbrush, try
            using a wider rubber strap to wrap around the patient’s hand and the
            toothbrush handle. You can enlarge the brush handle by taping it to
            a sponge or rubber grip. You can also lengthen the handle of the
            toothbrush by taking a tongue depressor or a ruler to the handle.

              Improved dental floss is wider, thinner, and slicker than in the
              past, which makes flossing easier and more productive. Special
              floss holders are available for patients with physical
              disabilities. Daily flossing is recommended.

              Most people do not clean their tongues. Debris can collect on the
              tongue’s surface around the taste buds, which can lead to
              periodontal disease. If the patient’s tongue appears to have a
              grayish tint, tongue cleaning is recommended. While some people
              brush their tongues, special tongue cleaners are more effective to
              remove debris. Scraping of the top surface of the tongue once or
              twice daily is suggested to reduce the germs in the mouth.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Good oral hygiene is important because a healthy mouth is important
            for speaking, chewing, and overall health and well-being. The aide
            has an important role in performing oral hygiene, reinforcing
            education on healthy eating, and observing and reporting signs and
            symptoms that could lead to serious oral disease.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the special considerations with many elderly patients, it is
            essential that all older adults receive daily dental health care. It
            is important for the aide and family members to learn proper dental
            care and hygiene.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, elderly patients are sensitive to having their mouth touched
            and their teeth cleaned. They may have pain or a history of negative
            experiences with dentistry. Some things to remember when providing
            dental hygiene to patients include:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Move slowly and explain exactly what you are going to do before
            touching a patient’s teeth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When brushing or flossing teeth, talk in a soft, soothing manner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there is pain, stop what you are doing or perform the task in
            another manner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If assigned by the care plan, use fluoride rinses to reduce the
            amount of brushing required.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Use proper brushing technique:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use a toothbrush with soft, round-ended bristles that will not
            irritate teeth or damage gums.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Placing the bristles at the gum line, gently brush the outer surface
            of a couple of teeth at a time using a back and forth motion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Follow the same procedure on the inner teeth and the biting surface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Brush the tongue with a backward to forward motion to remove
            harmful, odor- causing bacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Use proper flossing technique:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Wind about 18 inches of floss around middle fingers of each hand.
            (If the patient uses tread-type floss, follow this same technique).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use thumbs and index fingers to direct floss between teeth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Guide floss between teeth using a zigzag motion, contouring the
            floss around the side of each tooth and under the gum line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If the patient is not used to flowing, the gums may bleed and be
            sore for about a week. This should go away. Don’t forget to floss
            behind the last teeth in the patient’s mouth, on each side. While
            flossing the patient’s teeth, speak calmly with him or her, or turn
            on the radio or TV for a distraction.

          <p>Care for dentures:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking care of the patient’s dentures will help reduce the bacteria
            in the mouth and will help prevent false teeth from becoming
            stained. Daily cleaning will remove plaque and food and prevent
            staining.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Rinse dentures thoroughly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Brush the entire surface using the appropriate cleanser, Use a
            soft-bristle brush and handle carefully to avoid breaking the
            dentures. There are brushes made specifically for cleaning dentures.
            If using a regular toothbrush, avoid any hard- bristled brush that
            may damage dentures. The patient’s dentist can recommend an approved
            cleaning solution, but a gentle hand soap or dishwashing liquid is
            also safe to use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When not in use, store the dentures in water or a soaking solution
            to prevent them from drying out and cracking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Before placing dentures in the mouth, gently brush the gums and roof
            of the mouth with toothpaste to remove plaque and stimulate the
            gums.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            For patients who clean their own dentures, make sure they perform
            the procedure according to directions provided by the dental
            professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Any denture that is broken, chipped, or cracked should be
            professionally repaired by the patient’s dentist. If the denture is
            loose or ill-fitting, it should be taken to the dentists
            immediately, because poorly fitting dentures can make painful sores
            in the mouth.

          <p>
            One area where the home health aide can have the biggest impact on
            the patient’s oral health is encouraging a healthy diet. Because
            diet contributes to the patient’s overall health, proper eating is
            essential. Elderly people may not feel like eating well for a
            variety or reasons such as mental health, medication use, or the
            general aging process. You must understand what factors can
            contribute to a poor diet and how to effectively assist the patient.

          <p>
            A healthy diet includes lots of fruits and vegetables and whole
            grains, and minimal amounts of fats and sweets. Many of the foods
            that help your body build and maintain strong muscles and bones also
            help build strong, healthy teeth and gums. A healthy diet consists
            of foods from the following groups.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>
            Dairy:{" "}
            <span class="p">
              Dairy products provide calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus to build
              and maintain strong teeth and bones. The elderly are more
              susceptible to root surface cavities because of bone loss around
              the teeth. Good dairy sources include low-fat milk, cheese, and
              yogurt.

              Whole grains supply B vitamins for growth and iron for healthy
              blood, which in turn contributes to healthy gum tissue. Choose
              high-fiber breads, cereals, and rice.

              Many fruits and vegetables are good source of vitamin C and folic

      <h1>Outcomes and the Home Health Aide</h1>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The list of outcomes that are used to evaluate the quality of care
        provided by you and your co-workers includes things such as improvement
        in ambulation, transferring, managing oral medications, and difficulty
        breathing. You may think that oral hygiene has nothing to do with those
        outcomes. However, when you think a little harder, you may begin to find
        many connections between oral hygiene and the outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Many times, it’s the simplest things that have the biggest effect on
        outcomes. Poor oral hygiene can lead to the loss of teeth, infection,
        oral pain, and loss of appetite. All of those things may affect your
        patient’s well-being and emotional status. Without proper care, each of
        these areas may worsen. Once that happens, it’s difficult for patients
        to make any progress in other areas of their care. The patient may begin
        to deteriorate, and may require hospitalization or nursing home
        placement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep this in mind when assigned to provide oral hygiene to your
        patients. You’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that this simple
        assignment helps your patient feel better immediately and ahs long term
        effects as well.
