      <h1>Meal Planning</h1>
      <p>
        The elderly continue to be the fastest growing segment of the population
        in the United States. It is also the most susceptible to many health
        risks from a nutrient-poor diet. Physiological, psychological and
        economical changes in the later years of life all contribute to poor
        nutrition among the elderly. For instance, arthritis makes it difficult
        for the elderly to shop and prepare food. A decreased ability to taste
        and smell affects the enjoyment of food. The loss of teeth and poorly
        fitting dentures can cause chewing problems and mouth sores, making
        eating difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Elderly who live alone and/or face financial difficulties tend to skimp
        on food and may rely on less costly and less nutritious foods. Then
        again, some neglect their nutrition because they lack the cooking skills
        and knowledge about nutrition. This occurs often after the death of the
        spouse who used to prepare the meals in the household. Some suffer from
        loneliness and depression, or weakness and fatigue. Others consume too
        much deep-fried, oily food instead of more nutrient- dense foods like
        fruit, vegetables and whole grains. It’s easier to fry an egg than peel
        an orange.

        Metabolic rates and energy needs decrease as a person ages. The elderly
        need to consume the same amount of nutrients as when they were younger
        but with fewer calories to prevent weight gain. They also need
        protein-rich foods in their diet to maintain lean tissue mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to identify these issues when planning meals for the
        elderly to promote proper nutritional intake.

        The goal of meal planning for the elderly is to plan meals that they can
        eat, taking into consideration their age, weight, height and activity
        level, special requirements, preparation concerns and likes and
        dislikes. Meal planning should also incorporate recommendations of the
        USDA <i>MyPyramid </i>diet.

      <p class="s1">STEP ONE: COLLECT BASIC DIETARY INFORMATION</p>
      <p>
        It’s important to identify what foods can and can’t be included in meal
        planning. To do this, meal planners look at any medical restrictions,
        patient preferences or other factors that will have an impact on the
        process. These can include the following:
      </p>
      <p>

            Special diets:{" "}
            <span class="p">
              Medical conditions, including asthma, autism, colitis, congestive
              heart disease, diabetes, Crohn’s disease and irritable bowel
              syndrome, to name a few, can lead to dietary restrictions and
              recommendations. It is extremely important to know about and
              follow any medical restrictions. Most often, this involves
              eliminating or adding certain foods to the diet.

            Allergies:{" "}
            <span class="p">
              Many people have food allergies. Some can have violent allergic
              reactions when consuming certain foods, such as milk, eggs,
              peanuts, tree nuts (such as cashews and walnuts), fish shellfish,
              soy and wheat. A good planner always asks the patient about these
              food allergies or any others. This helps to avoid inadvertent use
              of offending foods in meal planning and prevent a life-threatening
              allergic reaction.

                  meal at midday and a light meal in the evening. Others may
                  prefer to have five or six smaller meals, divided into a light
                  breakfast, an early light lunch, a mid- afternoon snack, a

                  In most homes, it is necessary to work within a budget. The
                  meal plan should take into consideration the financial status
                  of the patient and the budget available for purchasing
                  groceries. It helps to check newspaper ads for daily specials
                  and seasonal bargains. For example, fresh fruits and
                  vegetables cost less during the summer and fall. At other
                  times, it is more economical to purchase frozen, canned or
                  dried items. A patient may choose to purchase in bulk and
                  freeze the food. The food should be wrapped tightly and
                  labeled with the type of food and date purchased.

        If money is a consideration, then plan meals and purchase food around
        the prices. Careful planning makes it possible to meet nutritional needs
        while keeping costs at a minimum. When a patient has limited funds and
        proper meal planning can’t occur, notify the patient’s case manager. He
        or she can refer this patient to a social worker who can assist the
        patient in finding community resources for food.

      <p class="s1">STEP THREE: DEVELOP THE MEAL PLAN</p>
      <p>
        After learning about the patient’s preferences and restrictions, it’s
        time to plan the meals. The patient may have a recipe box, files or
        cookbooks for review. Or the patient or family caregiver can share
        ideas. Compare these recipes to the USDA recommendations for planning
        healthy meals. Then plan some meals for the patient. How many and which
        ones depends on the patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Follow these tips when planning:</p>
      <ul id="l5">
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a plan for one week. This, however, depends on factors such
            as the money available for groceries.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Incorporate foods from all the food groups and choose a variety of
            foods from each group. Variety prevents boredom and a loss of
            interest in food.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consider these characteristics of the foods:</p>
          <ul id="l6">
            <li>
              <p>
                COLOR: Nutritionists advise making the plate look like a
                painter’s palette. If the plate is colorful, the patient is
                eating enough fruits and vegetables and the meals are balanced.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                TEXTURE: Soft, crunchy and chewy foods provide variety and help
                to fill the meal plan with different kinds of foods according to{" "}
                <i>MyPyramid </i>guidelines. For example, chewy breads, crunchy
                cereal and smooth, tender pasta add the essential servings of
                grains.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                TEMPERATURE: Providing different foods at hot, cold and room
                temperature makes the meal more interesting and helps to
                stimulate the appetite.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Include foods that the patient likes to eat. There is no logic to
            explain why some people like certain foods and dislike others. There
            are individuals who want steak served rare, while others will eat it
            well done only. Some people dislike carrots, cabbage or mushrooms.
            The meal plan should address these preferences.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Besides paying attention to allergies and medical restrictions,
            consider any religious or ethnic considerations the patient may
            have.
            <i>
              <b>One example: </b>
            </i>
            <i>The patient follows a kosher diet for religious reasons.</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the food in the patient’s cupboard and then find recipes that
            use these ingredients. Then gradually introduce different foods and
            flavors and expand tastes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Involve the patient and family</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="s1">STEP FOUR: WRITE THE SHOPPING LIST</p>
      <p>
        Once the patient and/or family has approved of the final meal plan,
        check to see what items are available in the home to prepare the planned
        meals and what needs to be purchased. Then, put together the shopping
        list. Consider storage space available in the patient’s refrigerator,
        freezer and cupboards, before buying large quantities of foods. Add to
        the list any non-food items that the patient might need, such as
        tissues, light bulbs, laundry detergent and softener and finally,
        collect available coupons for food on the shopping list. Because someone
        else may do the shopping, the list should be legible with detailed
        instructions about sizes, quantity, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss the shopping list with the patient and/or family. Not only will
        this help to determine and validate the patient’s wishes, but it may
        also provide an opportunity to involve the family in caring for the
        patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="s1">STEP FIVE: SHOP FOR FOOD</p>
      <p>
        Agency policy defines the home health aide’s role in grocery shopping.
        It’s possible that a family member may use the shopping list to purchase
        the necessary groceries. Or maybe the social worker arranges for a
        shopping service to purchase and deliver the groceries. If shopping is
        an assigned task, the aide must understand the agency’s policies,
        including how to track time, how to pay for groceries, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If the assignment includes shopping, identify grocery stores in the
        area. A patient may prefer Mexican dishes. So the corner market selling
        ethnic foods may be a better place to shop than the big grocery store.
        Check the paper for current sales or coupons. One store may have more of
        the items on a shopping list than another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        When at the grocery store, carefully select items for purchase. Also:
      </p>
      <ul id="l7">
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the patient’s needs when more than one size of a product is
            available.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the nutritional labels on the products. “Nutrition Facts”
            identify the protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, sodium and fiber
            content of each food. Choose those that provide the most nutrition,
            least fat, least sodium and/or sugar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Obtain the receipt for the groceries to give to the patient to
            verify purchases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="s1">STEP SIX: PREPARE AND SERVE THE MEAL</p>
          <p>
            The home health aide assignment or care plan identifies the aide’s
            role in meal preparation. If this is something you have never done,
            talk with a supervisor before being assigned to prepare meals for a
            patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Preparing food properly retains vitamins and nutrients and provides
            for an appealing dish. Foods may be prepared in a number of ways,
            such as broiled, baked, fried, boiled or steamed and some eaten raw.
            Check the recipe or ask the patient for preparation instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Remember these general instructions:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do not overcook food. Overcooking can cause the loss of minerals,
            vitamins and other nutrients and cause foods to become mushy and
            unappetizing. Overcooked meats become tough and lose flavor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Wash vegetables and fruits whether eating them raw or cooked.
            Properly cooked vegetables retain their natural color, enhancing the
            appearance of the meal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rinse meats thoroughly under cold running water. Pay particular
            attention to pork and chicken and cook these meats until well done
            to prevent illness.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Present food to please the eye. A cheerful presentation can add a
            lot t a meal and make mealtimes more enjoyable. Nicely arranged food
            adds to the pleasure and enjoyment of eating. Foods that appeal to
            the eye perk up the appetite.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Focus on flavor and aroma to set the digestive juices in action.
            Salt, pepper and garlic are commonly used seasonings (if not
            restricted by a medical condition). Other herbs, such as thyme,
            rosemary, parsley and sage, sharpen the flavor of food and are good
            for patients on a salt-free diet. Squeezing fresh lemon juice over
            meat and vegetables also provides flavor to foods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serving the meal is just as important as planning and preparation.
            Before putting food on the table, prepare the patient. Assisting
            with oral hygiene or toileting before sitting down to eat can help
            stimulate the appetite. Tidy up the eating area and minimize
            distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Assist the patient to prepare the food. This can be cutting the
            meat, buttering the bread or pouring the coffee. Never put more food
            on the plate than a patient may be able to eat. It’s better to
            provide seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="s1">STEP 7: EVALUATE THE PATIENT’S RESPONSE TO THE MEAL</p>
          <p>
            How did the patient eat? Did he or she like the meal? Does the
            patient have any recommendations for changes? Document the patient’s
            response and any pertinent comments about his or her appetite and
            eating. Note any suggestions for future meal planning.{" "}
            <i>
              For example, the patient likes his scrambled eggs soft, not dried
              out.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t throw out the old plans. Update the meal plan and file for
            future use. With some adjustments, these plans can serve as the
            basis for future meals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="s1">THE AIDE’S ROLE</p>
          <p>
            As noted in some of the steps, the home health aide’s role in the
            meal preparation process varies. Some patients may need just one
            meal prepared, while others will need assistance through out the
            meal planning process. Always check the assignment sheet or care
            plan to identify your responsibilities. But remember, each step in
            the process flows out of the previous one. If your only assignment
            is to make breakfast for the patient, someone has to have planned
            the meal and purchased the food. If you are unable to carry out your
            assignment because there is no oatmeal or juice in the patient’s
            kitchen, notify your supervisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Meal Preparation Form</h3>
          <p>
            It takes organization to plan meals for a week at a time. To meet
            the needs of the patient, follow the seven steps in the meal
            planning process. A meal preparation form can help with this
            process. It identifies the patient’s specific needs and concerns,
            and notes the plan and shopping list. This information is readily
            available not only to the home health aide but also the patient and
            any family members or caregivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="s1">OUTCOMES AND THE HOME HEALTH AIDE</p>
          <p>
            Well planned meals serve two purposes: They provide the nutrients
            that maintain bodily functions and assist in the healing process
            after hospitalization, surgery or injury. And they are appealing and
            appetizing so that patient enjoys eating them. These nutrients
            promote wellness not only on a short-term basis but also long-term
            as the proper diet can assist a person in avoiding complications of
            diabetes and other chronic diseases. Good nutrition also helps
            elderly patients to maintain their best level of activity and mental
            status.

            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently
            provides agencies and the public with 12 home health quality
