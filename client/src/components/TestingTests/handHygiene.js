            Infections acquired as a result of medical care or treatment, called
            nosocomial infections, are a serious threat to patients in today’s
            health care system. Since these infections occur not only in health
            care facilities, but also in the homes of homecare patients, it is
            important that homecare aides know how to prevent them. Some of
            these infections, such as Methicillin-resistant{" "}
            <i>Staphylococcus areus </i>(MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant
            <i>Enterocci </i>(VRE), are very hard to treat and resist many of
            today’s antibiotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            There are approximately 90,000 nosocomial infection-related patient
            deaths each year, costing the U.S. $4.5 billion annually. One of the
            man problems is health care staff failing to wash or sanitize hands.
            Estimates show that nearly 40 percent of hand hygiene
          </p>
          <p>
            activities are done improperly. These activities include taking a
            patient’s blood pressure or pulse, assisting him or her with
            walking, touching the patient’s gown or bed sheets, and touching
            equipment near the patient, such as bed rails, blood pressure
            equipment, and even TV remotes.

          <p>Principles of Hand Hygiene:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1975, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
            recommended handwashing with non-antimicrobial soap between the
            majority of patient contacts, and washing with antimicrobial soap
            before and after performing medical procedures and care for
            high-risk patients. The use of waterless antiseptic agents, such as
            alcohol-based solutions, was recommended only in situations where
            sinks were not available. In 2002, the CDC changed its focus from
            handwashing to hand hygiene. The CDC still recommends handwashing,
            but now also, the use of alcohol-based sanitizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Infections may or may not be obvious on a patient’s skin, equipment,
            and/or nearby furniture. When caregivers provide care to patients,
            their hands can encounter and pick up the infectious organisms and
            carry them to the other patients they touch. The goad of good hand
            hygiene is to break this cycle of transferring germs from one
            patient to another. Good habits can stop the spread of infections
            and diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            A person’s behavior is one of the biggest factors affecting hand
            hygiene practices. Sometimes, an aide does not know when it’s
            necessary to wash hands. If a sink is not convenient, patients often
            take priority and an aide may skip the handwashing to get started on
            the patient care immediately. In many cases, an aide is just too
            busy, forgetful, or doesn’t understand the positive effects
            handwashing can have. When bad hand hygiene behaviors are present in
            an agency, it takes a diligent focus to correct them. All homecare
            managers and direct care staff should receive education regarding
            the importance of good hand hygiene, along with opportunities to see
            and practice good hand hygiene practices.

          <p>Hand Cleaning Agents:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of cleaning agents is typically based on the feel, smell,
            consistency, and level of skin irritation it causes. An agency
            identifies products for hand hygiene, which field staff should carry
            with them to patients’ homes. It is also important to know and
            follow agency procedures for using a nursing bag and learning how to
            supply, clean, and protect it.

          <p class="s2">Soaps:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning good handwashing technique is easy and can significantly
            reduce the spread of infectious diseases. All it requires is some
            soap, water, and friction. Why doe it work so well? Handwashing
            pulls the oily dirt free from the skin. The soap lather suspends
            both the dirt and germs trapped inside, and the water washes them
            away.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Soaps are detergent-based products and come in various forms
            including bars, tissues, leaves, and liquids; however, liquid soap
            is preferred. (Although, adding liquid soap to a
          </p>
          <p>
            partially empty soap dispenser or “topping it off” can contaminate
            the soap.) Bar soap tends to leave a build-up on the tray where it
            can foster microbial growth. It can also retain germs from users if
            not rinsed properly. If bar soap is the only option, use small bars
            and store them on a rack that facilitates drainage to prevent
            bacterial growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            A soap’s cleaning ability comes from its detergent properties, which
            remove dirt, soil, and various organic substances from the hands.
            Plain soaps have minimal, if any, ability to kill microorganisms.
            However, handwashing with plain soap is better than nothing at all,
            as it removes dirt and many germs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="s2">Alcohol-based Hand Sanitizers:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The CDC and infection control organizations now recommend that
            health care staff use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer routinely.
            These sanitizers, which are available as gels, rinses, or foams,
            should be used between patient contacts as long as the hands are not
            dirty.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Alcohol hand sanitizers, with at least 60 percent alcohol, are
            excellent disinfectants in all caregiving situations. Sanitizers are
            most effective in reducing the number of bacteria on hands.
            (Antiseptic soaps and detergents are less effective, while
            non-antimicrobial soaps are the least effective.) Hand sanitizers
            also save time. It takes less than one-fourth as much time to use an
            alcohol-based hand sanitizer versus traditional handwashing at a
            sink, so it’s easier to comply with hand hygiene guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Hand sanitizers are widely used in homecare when water is not
            available. However, when hands are visibly dirty or soiled with
            blood or other body fluids, handwashing with soap and water is more
            effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Some waterless hand sanitizers don’t contain alcohol. Alcohol-based
            sanitizers are best since they significantly reduce the number of
            organisms on the skin and are fast acting. The alcohol kills germs
            quickly when applied to the skin; however, the effects are not
            long-lasting so repeated applications are necessary. Alcohol
            sanitizers are safe since the alcohol content evaporates in 15
            seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove visible dirt,
            then apply the product to the palm of one hand and rub hands
            together, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers until hands
            are dry. The volume needed to reduce the number of bacteria on hands
            varies by product.
          </p>

          <p class="s2">Towelettes and Hand Wipes:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Antimicrobial wipes may be used as an alternative to washing hands
            with non- antimicrobial soap and water. However, they are not as
            effective as other methods for reducing bacteria, so they should not
            be a substitute for alcohol-based hand sanitizers or antimicrobial
            soap.

          <p>Maintaining Skin Health:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Frequent handwashing can cause skin irritation or contact
            dermatitis. If hands are irritated, an aide may not wash his or her
            hands as often as necessary to prevent the spread of infection.
            Frequent and scheduled use of an oil-containing lotion can improve
            skin condition and lead to an increase in handwashing frequency.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>These strategies can reduce skin irritation:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use a mild soap with warm water. When finished, pat rather than rub
            hands dry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            After handwashing, use hand lotions or cream, which often contain
            various fats and oils to increase skin hydration and improve the
            barrier function of normal skin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Apply a barrier cream to reduce irritation. Hand sanitizers that
            contain emollients are designed to prevent hand hygiene-related
            irritant contact dermatitis. Such products are absorbed into the
            superficial layers of the epidermis to form a protective layer that
            is not removed by standard handwashing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reduce the frequency of exposure to irritating agents. An aide can
            do this by wearing gloves while washing dishes, or not washing hands
            with soap and water after using an alcohol-based sanitizer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Replace irritating products with those that cause less damage to the
            skin. It’s possible for a person to be sensitive to one hand
            sanitizer but not another.

          <p>Gloves:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1987, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
            mandated that health care staff wear gloves during patient care
            activities involving exposure to blood or body fluids contaminated
            with blood. Gloves are not foolproof and cannot solely prevent the
            spread of all infections, so be aware of proper usage and gloves’
            limitations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Change gloves during patient care when moving from a contaminated
            body site to a clean body site.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remove gloves after caring for a patient, and perform hand hygiene.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do not wear the same pair of gloves for more than one patient’s
            care, and do not wash gloves between uses with different patients.

            Microorganisms can be transmitted if an aide fails to remove gloves

            Hands can become contaminated when gloves are removed or discarded

        Clean under the fingernails and keep natural nails between one-quarter

        Freshly applied nail polish does not increase bacteria levels on hands,
        but chipped nail polish may support the growth of organisms and
        bacteria. Even after careful handwashing or using personal protective
        equipment, chipped polish can harbor substantial numbers of potential
        pathogens.

        It is not known whether artificial nails contribute to spreading
        infections. However, caregivers with artificial nails are more likely to
        harbor pathogens on their fingertips than those who have natural nails.

        Several studies have demonstrated that skin underneath rings and
        bracelets has more germs than the same areas of skin without these
        items. When possible, remove jewelry from hands and arms before washing
        hands, or avoid wearing jewelry at all.

      <h1>The Aide’s Role</h1>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Provide Care:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Always review the aide assignment sheet before providing care. Wear
        personal protective equipment as required, depending on the care
        situation. This generally includes gloves and gowns, but may also
        include safety glasses or face masks. If you have cuts of scrapes, clean
        them and apply an adhesive bandage before going into the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Use either an alcohol-based sanitizer or soap and running water after
        entering and before leaving a patient’s home, and before and after
        certain patient care activities, such as wound care or toileting, and
        after removing gloves. When washing your hands, use the sink closest to
        where you provide care. Follow these simple hand hygiene guidelines to
        provide better care to your patients.

      <p class="s3">Hand Sanitizer Steps:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: Apply a dime-size amount (or manufacturer’s recommended amount)
        of sanitizer to your hands – enough so that when you rub your hands
        together it covers the tops and bottoms of your hands, as well as under
        your nails.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Use a rubbing motion to distribute the sanitizer evenly for
        about 15 seconds or until your hands feel dry, whichever is longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Step 3: Wash your hands at the next opportunity.</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Use hand lotion to counter the alcohol’s drying effects.{" "}
        <u>Handwashing Steps:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: Rinse your hands well under warm, running water. Warm water is
        less damaging to the skin and creates a better lather.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: If using liquid soap, dispense one or two pumps from the
        container; if using bar soap, rub soap onto your hands for several
        seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Rub your hands together for at least 10 to 20 seconds, making a
        soapy lather away from the running water. Wash the tops and bottoms of
        your hands, your wrists, as well as between your fingers and under your
        nails. Use friction to help remove germs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Rinse your hands and wrists with your fingers pointed down to
        prevent water from running down your arms and recontamination your clean
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 5: Dry your hands thoroughly with a clean towel or disposable
        towel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 6: Turn off the water with a paper towel to prevent recontamination
        of your hands, and dispose in a proper receptacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Step 7: Apply lotion to prevent hands from becoming chapped.</p>

      <h1>Reinforce education:</h1>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Determine whether there are any special precautions to take during the
        process, and talk to the patient about how proper hand hygiene can have
        an impact on his or her health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remind the family or significant others to wash their hands carefully
        after touching the patient and before leaving the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <h1>Observe and report:</h1>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you observe signs or symptoms of new infections, such as drainage,
        report these finding to the patient’s case manager according to agency
        policy. If your role includes simple wound care, know your agency’s
        policy for hand hygiene, such as using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
        before and after wearing gloves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, document the care you provided during the home visit along with
        the patient’s response.
      </p>

        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        By following standards of care, as well as practicing good hand hygiene
        while caring for patients, a home health aide can improve his or her
        agency’s quality measures. Proper hand hygiene can reduce the spread of
        infection, which means fewer wound infections and hospitalizations or
        visits to the emergency room.
