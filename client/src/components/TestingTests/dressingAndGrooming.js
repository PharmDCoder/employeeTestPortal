        At first glance, getting ready for the day is so clear-cut and easy that
        we often don’t give it a second thought. We simply get dressed, brush
        our teeth, comb our hair and perform all the other tasks we need to do
        to make ourselves presentable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />

            For people who have physical or mental impairments, dressing and
            grooming tasks are often difficult to manage alone. Sometimes they
            might take their frustration out on the people around them.

            Throughout history, people have put importance on both grooming and

            Those old-fashioned hoop skirts made getting through a door or into
            a carriage very difficult and, if a woman sat down too fast, the
            hoop could fly up and break her nose!

            For centuries, Asian men <i>and</i>women have worn pants for warmth,
            comfort and convenience. In ancient Rome and Greece, both men and
            women wore “dresses” called <i>tunics</i>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Until 1970, it was not fashionable—and sometimes against the law—for
            American women to wear pants in offices, classrooms and restaurants.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The ancient Greeks were the first to wear girdles. A band of linen
            or soft leather was bound around a woman’s waist and lower torso to
            control her shape.

            Some wealthy Europeans in the 1600’s wore six-inch-high heels. It
            took two servants, one on either side, to hold the person up!

            During the middle-ages, people “deodorized” their clothing with the
            smoke from a wood fire.

        <li>
          <p>
            Underarm deodorants were first used during the 18th century. And in
            the late 19th century the first commercial deodorant, Mums, was
            introduced.

            The 18th century French used carbonated water as a hair spray to

          <p>
            Ancient Egyptians used wigs, hair extensions, henna and makeup to
            improve their looks. However, women were put to death if they wore
            nail polish of “royal colors”.

            During the 1960’s, purple was the most popular color for lipstick.

            Until the 20th century, water was thought to be harmful for teeth.

            Most women weren’t concerned about shaving their underarms until a
            1915 media campaign pushed the idea that underarm hair on a lady was
            unfeminine and unhealthy. Who paid for that campaign?{" "}

            Letting your clients choose their own clothing gives them feelings
            of being independent and in charge.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cheering clients on to do their best while dressing supports a team
            spirit and gives them a feeling of belonging.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Allowing your clients to do as much as they can by themselves helps
            their self- reliance grow.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Voicing your approval during dressing and grooming gives clients a
            sense of being valued.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Looking good boosts each client’s self esteem and may even help a
            bad mood disappear!

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Dressing your client helps protect the skin from injury and maintain
            proper body temperature.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Making sure your clients’ clothing fits properly keeps all of their
            body systems unrestricted.

        </li>
        <li>

            Brushing your clients’ hair promotes a healthy scalp and strong

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Providing daily mouth care prevents the onset of painful mouth
            conditions and protects the mouth from oral diseases.

          <p>
            Keeping your clients’ fingernails trimmed with no ragged edges
            prevents scratches and cuts that can cause infection.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reporting toenail changes helps your clients get care from a
            podiatrist as needed. This can prevent complications for people with
            diabetes, heart conditions or poor circulation.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Moving your clients’ joints and muscles during the grooming process
            helps maintain body movement and prevents contractures.

          <h3>
            Dressing and grooming tasks give you daily opportunities to look for
            clues that trouble may be brewing:
          </h3>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be aware of clients’ facial expressions. Clients may tell you that
            they have no pain, but their faces may reveal the real story.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Clients get in and out of clothes several times a day. While
            assisting them, look over the whole body, making note of any areas
            of redness, rashes, bed sores or other changes in the skin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Report any unusual body odors. A strange odor may be a symptom of an
            illness.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some health conditions cause the body to swell. Watch for signs of
            swollen hands (such as tight rings) and swollen feet (such as shoes
            and socks suddenly being too small).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            As you brush or comb your client’s hair, check for head lice. (Lice
            can happen to <i>anyone</i>—no matter how young or old, dirty or
            clean, rich or poor.) Look for white eggs known as “nits”. They look
            like small bits of dandruff, but do not wash or flake off. Instead
            they stick <i>firmly </i>to strands of hair.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you provide nail care, look for white or yellow areas on finger
            and toe nails. Your client may have a nail fungus.

            Pants and dresses with cutaway seats aid those with limited
            mobility. Wrap-around skirts and shawls are safer for wheel-chair
            bound women.

        </li>
        <li>

            Loose tops, sweaters and bottoms that button in front are good

            Front closing bras are useful for women who have limited use of

            Track suits with elasticized waists make dressing easier for clients
            with joint and muscle problems—and for those who have short term
            memory lapses.

            Several outfits that

          <p>
            You may want to avoid accessories like belts and scarves. They can
            be confusing for some clients, and difficult for others to put on.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If possible, use clothing that fastens with Velcro or zippers rather

        <li>
          <p>
            Before you begin care, explain that you have come to assist them
            with dressing and grooming. Ask permission to touch them and tell
            them
            <u>what</u> you will do and <u>how</u> you will do it. (Explaining
            what you are going to do, <i>in advance, </i>decreases the chance
            that your clients will react negatively.)
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Remember to provide privacy by closing room doors and pulling bed
            curtains. It’s important to make sure that your clients’ bodies are
            not overly exposed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Don’t touch your clients’ personal belongings unless it’s necessary.
            If you do handle their belongings, be careful and put the items back
            where you found them.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do your best to go along with your clients’ personal preferences
            every day. . . such as letting them decide which clothes they’d like
            to wear or how they’d like their hair fixed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember that everyone has the right to participate in his or her
            own care. So, encourage your clients to get involved in their
            personal care. Even if they aren’t strong enough to get dressed by
            themselves, they can probably wash their faces or comb their hair.
            The more they do for themselves, the more independent they will
            remain!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check to see if clients are okay as you assist them. When you
            complete your care, encourage clients to let you know what you can
            do to make them more comfortable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Never threaten your clients to get them to cooperate. For example,
            it’s wrong to say,
          </p>
          <p class="s1">
            “If you don’t get dressed right now, you can’t watch TV this
            afternoon”<span class="p">.</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If your clients are wearing anything unusual, keep in mind that they
            may be doing so for religious or cultural reasons. You may see a
            thread woven into their hair, a medicine bundle on a string around
            their neck or a ribbon wrapped around their wrist. Don’t remove any
            item from your client without their permission!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember that all clients have the right to refuse treatment. For
            example, if a client becomes aggressive when you arrive to give a
            bath, let your supervisor know that the client has refused your
            care.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Your clients have the right to be treated with respect—even if
            they’ve been “difficult” in the past. When you work with people who
            have given you trouble previously, try to start fresh every day.
            Forget about what happened yesterday, last week or last month.

            Remember that most confused clients have short attention spans and
            no sense of time or place, so help them feel more secure by giving a
            daily reminder of who you are and why you are there.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For confused clients, grooming and getting dressed involves a lot of
            steps and the use of many different skills. It can be a very
            confusing time. If they get confused or frightened, they may become
            irritable, uncooperative or upset. Try to keep the environment calm
            and peaceful. Turn off any TV or loud music before beginning
            personal care and provide your confused clients with frequent gentle
            reminders of what you expect from them as you assist with their
            personal care.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Try reassuring your confused clients by smiling, holding their
            hands, keeping your movements gentle and maintaining a relaxed and
            upbeat body language.

          <p>
            Lay out clothes in the <i>order </i>that your client will put them
            on. Then, give short, simple instructions to help your client
            complete one step at a time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be patient. If you rush a confused client, it will only create
            anxiety.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Your clients may be more cooperative if you give them something to
            do. Let them help by putting toothpaste on a toothbrush, holding a
            sock while you put on a shoe or folding some washcloths as you brush
            their hair.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider using a “mirroring technique” when assisting confused
            clients. For example, hold a toothbrush and pretend to brush{" "}
            <i>your </i>teeth to help a client understand how to perform the
            task himself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Most women with Alzheimer’s disease stop using make-up during the
            early stages of the illness. However, if a woman has <i>always </i>
            worn make-up in the past, she may feel more comfortable if you help
            her apply some.

          <p>
            If a client with dementia removes his or her clothing in public, try
            to figure out why. It may be that the clothes are too warm or are
            made of fabric that is irritating the skin.

          <p>
            When clients have shaky limbs, sit and talk to them for a few

            when clients are feeling relaxed.

            Keep in mind that many people with arthritis suffer from “morning
            stiffness”. Their joints may be especially swollen and painful
            during morning grooming and dressing tasks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Encourage your arthritic clients to dress their legs and feet first
            as this requires the most energy. Have them sit down for as much of
            the dressing and grooming process as possible—to save energy and to
            keep them from having to bend over so far.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Avoid clothing that fastens in the back. (For example, a front
            fastening bra is much easier to put on.) and, cardigan sweaters are
            easier than garments that pull over the head.
          </p>

            <br />
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Remember that some days are better than others for people with
            arthritis. Don’t be surprised if your clients can function pretty
            well one day and need lots of help the next.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the fit of your client’s shoes. Remember that people’s feet
            can change size as they age. If shoes are too small, they will put
            pressure on sensitive joints. If shoes are too large, they put your
            client at risk for falling.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember that some of your clients may have specially made splints
            to help keep their joints in the correct position and reduce pain.
            Your clients may need help putting on and taking off these splints.

          <p>
            Encourage your clients to use any self-help devices they may have to
            help them bathe, dress or eat. If they don’t know how to use a
            particular assistive device, let your supervisor know.

            Help your clients avoid getting overtired from dressing and grooming

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a client asks you for a pain pill prior to going through the
            motions of getting dressed, let a nurse or family member know that
            the client is in pain and needs attention.

          <p>
            Remember that some of your clients may keep quiet about their pain
            due to fear, their beliefs or their cultural heritage. Be sure to
            look for non-verbal signs of pain such as:
          </p>
          <ul id="l2">

            Watch carefully to see what your clients are able to do for
            themselves and tell your supervisor if pain is keeping a client from
            performing everyday activities. Your observations may lead to
            important changes in the client’s plan of care.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Try to keep your clients laughing! It has been proven that laughter
            releases certain chemicals in the body that act as a natural pain
            medication. (Have you ever noticed how good you feel after you’ve
            let loose with a real “belly” laugh?)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            As you assist your clients with personal care, remember that it is
            your <i>duty </i>to notify your supervisor when you know—or
            suspect—that a client is in pain. Every client has the right to feel
            relief from the pain!

            Some of your clients may have been taught that they could get more
            wear out of clothes by airing them rather than washing them. And,
            many may have learned to save money by carrying around used tissues
            in their pockets. When time allows, check your clients’ closets,
            removing smelly, dirty clothes and old tissues from their pockets.

            While in a client’s home, put soiled clothing in plastic bags and

              {" "}
              Mr. Jones needs a shave. His electric razor is broken and he can’t
              use a safety razor because he is on blood thinners. His family is
              coming to visit within the hour. You’re tempted to use another
              client’s shaver…

            Solution:
            <span class="s5">
              Borrowing another client’s shaver is a bad idea because of the
              possibility of spreading a skin infection. Explain the situation
              to your supervisor and the family, and give the broken razor to
              the family for repair.

          <p class="s4">
            Remember:
            <span class="s5">
              Electric razors have small brushes that are made to clean them,
              but they are a safety hazard when clients are on oxygen therapy.
              Safety razors need to be discarded after one time use. Omit them
              when clients are on blood-thinning medications.

            Focusing on safety during dressing and grooming is important for
            both you and your clients because:

            Keep in mind that some of your clients may find it safer and easier
            to dress while lying down—especially when it comes to pulling up
            pants. If a client is weak on one side, encourage him or her to
            dress the <i>weaker </i>side first.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Don’t let your clients use towel racks or toilet paper holders to
            help them stand. If they seem to need a grab bar, report the
            situation to your supervisor.

            Use available equipment to help you lift or transfer clients, such

            Take advantage of electric beds by raising the bed to a comfortable

            Before lifting anything (or anyone) heavy, ask yourself these

          <ul id="l4">
            <li>

            Always bend your knees—<i>not your waist</i>—when picking up
            something (or someone).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lift in one continuous motion, without jerking. And, avoid twisting
            your body during the lift. If you must turn, turn with your{" "}
            <i>feet</i>, not with your body.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Report frayed wires on grooming devices like hair dryers or electric
            shavers to keep you and your clients safe.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider using a “buddy system” when caring for clients who have a
            history of being combative. This isn’t so you can “gang up” on the
            client, but so that you can remain safe as you perform client care.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make sure your clients wear supportive, rubber-soled shoes when they
            are moving around. Wearing only socks will increase their risk of
            falling. (Wearing closed toe, rubber-soled shoes will keep{" "}
            <u>you</u> safe, too!)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember that some people feel lightheaded when their body
            temperature drops. Help your clients maintain an even body
            temperature by dressing them appropriately for the weather and
            keeping them away from drafts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be sure to adjust your clients’ clothing when they are seated in
            wheelchairs to keep the clothes from being pulled into the wheels.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make sure your clients have access to all bells or other devices
            they can use to get your attention when needed. Be sure that all
            their needs—including safety issues— have been addressed before
            leaving <i>any </i>client unattended.

            Those with fragile hair do better when the hair is brushed for a

            African-American clients may prefer that a wide-tooth comb or pick
            be used on their hair.

        <li>

            People of Asian heritage often have thick, oily hair that does well

            Wigs with tangles? Comb the ends of the hair first, using a spray

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When brushing a client’s teeth, use gentle brush strokes—especially
            when cleansing the tongue from front to back.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When clients refuse to open their mouths for mouth care, brush the
            outsides of their teeth only (with their permission) and report the
            incident to your supervisor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To clean the tongue, dentists recommend the use of tongue scrapers
            instead of tooth brushes. If your client doesn’t have a scraper, use
            a sponge-tipped mouth swab (toothette) instead.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lemon and glycerin mouth swabs are good for soothing the insides of
            clients’ irritated mouths. However, avoid using them every day
            because they can harm the teeth, and cause some people to develop a
            discharge in the back of their mouths that can interfere with
            breathing and swallowing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you can’t find dentures, try looking in wastebaskets or garbage
            cans. Clients sometimes wrap them in tissues and napkins and they
            are accidentally thrown away.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Can’t get dentures into a client’s mouth? Are the dentures too loose
            for that client? You may have the <i>wrong </i>dentures. Confused
            clients can wander into other people’s rooms where they may take
            and/or swap dentures from one client’s bed stand to another.

            Missing eyeglasses have been located in staff lounges in sweater and

            Artificial eyes should be kept in marked containers. Clients have
            been known to wrap them in tissues; missing artificial eyes have
            been found in bed linens placed in laundry bins.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Complaints of blurred vision? Bent eyeglass frames and scratched
            lenses can cause this problem. Glasses are like good jewelry. Handle
            them gently, put them on and off with both hands, and keep them in
            their cases when not in use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Contacts work best when stored in containers filled with contact
            solution. Contact lenses and long fingernails do not mix well, so
            keep nails clean and short.

      <h2>Q &amp; A About Dressing and Grooming</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q: Many of my elderly clients insist that I trim their toe nails. Is
        this okay?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Check with your supervisor first. Your clients may have medial
        conditions, like diabetes, that put them at risk for infection. And,
        even if your elderly clients are healthy, their toe nails may be very
        difficult to trim since nails harden as we age. Many older people get
        their toe nails trimmed by a podiatrist. TIP: To break the routine of
        daily personal care, you might try playing “beauty parlor”. Have your
        client soak her hands in warm water while you make up the bed. Then, rub
        her hands with lotion…and if time allows, put a coat of polish on her
        nails.

      <h3>
        Q: What can I do when a client complains that her roommate stole her
        sweater?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Make sure the sweater actually belongs to her. If so, tell her you
        will look into the situation. Then, approach the roommate <i>alone </i>
        and, instead of demanding she take off her roommate’s sweater, stay calm
        and say something like, “
        <i>
          Mrs. Jones, I just found this sweater in your closet. The color goes
          so well with your eyes and it is much warmer than the one you have on.
          Let me help you change.
        </i>
        ” If possible, give the original sweater back to its owner in
        <i>private</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q: What’s the best way to help change the top clothing on someone with
        an IV?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A: To remove the dirty shirt or gown, take if off the arm{" "}
        <i>without </i>the IV first. Then, ease the top gently down the arm with
        the IV. Remove the IV bag from the pole and hold it in your hand—keeping
        it at a level <i>above </i>the client’s arm. Continue sliding the top
        over the

      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        IV bag, tubing and the client’s hand. Next, hang the IV bag back on the
        pole. To put a clean shirt or gown on the client, reverse the process,
        starting with the arm <i>with </i>the IV. NOTE: Do not attempt this
        process if your client’s IV bag is running through an IV pump. Ask your
        supervisor for assistance.

      <h3>
        Q: What can I do if a confused client grabs my hair while I am brushing
        hers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A: If you work in a facility, pull the call bell to get assistance. Keep
        calm as you place one of your hands higher than where her hand is.
        Gently take hold of your hair so your scalp does not hurt as much.
        Slowly slide your other hand down as far as you can without touching the
        client’s hand. Divert her attention and she may forget what she is doing
        and let your hair go. She may have just wanted to touch and does not
        realize she is hurting you. When others arrive to help you, let them
        know to talk softly and move slowly. Sudden, fast movements could make
        the client fearful and agitated.
