            Abrasion: An injury or scrape to the skin caused by sliding across a
            rough surface. Usually the top layer of skin is removed. While this
            appears to be minor, it can be very painful and easily infected,
            since dirt can get into the wound easily.

            Many of the patients who require aide services have problems that
            limit their mobility. Some of the common diagnoses that cause
            mobility problems include strokes, fractures, hip and knee
            replacements, leg problems caused by diabetes, and general weakness
            due to a chronic disease.

            Transferring patients is a frequent task for home health aides. It
            involves moving the patient from one area to another, either alone,
            with another person, or with the help of equipment. Manually lifting
            and transferring dependent patients are activities that may result
            in injury, especially back injuries, for both health care workers
            and patient.

          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Nurses have one of the highest rates of work-related back problems
            of all occupations, and injuries are increasing. Back injuries cost
            the health care industry almost $20 billion each year. Over three
            quarters of a million working days are lost each year due to back
            injuries in nursing, and almost 40,000 nurses report illnesses from
            back pain each year. Their work with patients involves frequent
            lifting and moving – often with the most dependent patients.

          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to back injuries, other problems that may occur during a
            transfer include falls and fractures, skin abrasions, bruises caused
            by bumping into equipment, and fainting caused by rapid movement and
            blood pressure changes.

          <p>
            Safety is a primary concern, for both patients and health care
            workers. The Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA), a
            department of the federal government, has studied ways to improve
            safety in the workplace, often learning from past injuries. Since
            working in homes is very different from working within an office,
            special consideration needs to be given to safe movement in
            homecare.

          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Home health aides provide many services requiring movement and it’s
            not always easy to recognize the problems with simple movements.
            While transfers and lifts obviously place stress on the aide, many
            other tasks are completed in a forward-bent position with a twisted
            trunk, which also places stress on the body.

          <p>
            Some of the tasks that can lead to injury if performed incorrectly
            include:

        <li>
          <p>Bathing a patient in bed</p>

            Equipment, support devices, and simple safety guidelines can help
            you maintain safety no matter which of the activities you are
            performing.

          <p>Body Mechanics:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep these body mechanics and personal awareness tips in mind to
            move a patient safely:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Before you begin, tell the patient exactly what you’re going to do.
            This will prevent the patient from making an unexpected, awkward
            movement that could cause you to lose balance. Look carefully at the
            patient to determine whether he or she feels comfortable and strong
            enough to make the transfer. Ask about any problems such as
            dizziness and don’t attempt to move the patient until it’s safe to
            do so.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the patient is stronger on one side than the other, transfer
            toward the strong side. This allows you to put most of your support
            on the weaker side, while the patient reaches and moves toward the
            surface with his or her strong side.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When transferring a patient, give yourself a wide base of support by
            placing your feet shoulder-distance apart, keep your back straight,
            tighten your abdominal muscles, bend your knees, and use your leg
            muscles for strength.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Move your entire body toward the direction of the transfer. Stay
            loose and move through the transfer. Don’t lock your knees, stiffen
            your back, or twist your spine, hoping to gain stability. Planting
            your feet firmly on the ground and maintaining the wide base of
            support will give you the necessary stability.
          </p>

          <p>A Safe Environment:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The design or layout of the workplace can make a big difference in
            ensuring safety. More and more offices and factories are being
            designed with ergonomics and safety in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when working in a patient’s home, you have little control
            over how well your work area is designed. To stay safe, keep these
            points in mind:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Before working with a patient, have a plan for dealing with the
            surroundings and problems. Look at the size and shape of the room
            and look for safety hazards, such as narrow hallways, doors, and
            other items that may block your path. Also, think about what you
            would do if this patient were to fall.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prepare the area for movement. Lace equipment correctly and check
            that you’ve chosen the shortest distance to transfer the patient.
            Move furniture if necessary to position the wheelchair next to a
            bed. Remove arms form wheelchairs, if possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use safety equipment and devices if they’re available, such as grab
            bars in the bathroom if the patient has installed them. Know that
            some devices may not be suitable for heavier patients.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Whenever possible, work at the highest level that will prevent the
            need to bend. If the patient is in a hospital bed, be sure to raise
            it to a comfortable working level.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Adjust lighting to the best level, which will help you clearly see
            your tasks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the status of the floors in the home. Watch out for wet or
            otherwise slippery floors. If something spills, immediately clean
            and dry the area to prevent falls
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>During the transfer:</p>
          <ul id="l2">
            <li>
              <p>
                Stand as close to the patient as possible, place both of your
                feet toe-to-toe with the patient, or one foot sideways
                immediately in front of both of the patient’s feet.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Look into the patient’s eyes and talk about the transfer. Count
                out loud, “1-2-3,” so that you both begin to move at the same
                time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do not grab the patient under the arms; reach completely around
                the patient to get a firm grip.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Do not allow the patient to pull on your neck.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <p class="s2">Special Equipment and Transfer Techniques</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Many types of lifts and supports are available to make moving patients
        easier. Studies have shown that the use of this type of equipment
        reduces worker injuries. While not all patients will have this
        equipment, it’s important to be familiar with the equipment, it’s
        important to be familiar with the equipment. Do not attempt to use such
        equipment unless you’ve been trained to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Side-to-side Transfers and Repositioning:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Use this technique when transferring a partial- or non-weight bearing
        patient between two flat surfaces such as a bed to a stretcher, or when
        repositioning the patient in bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        For safety, it requires more than one caregiver. Additional assistance
        may be needed depending upon the patient’s status, such as a heavier or
        uncooperative patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of a draw sheet or slide board may reduce friction and the amount of
        manual strength needed from the caregivers. A draw sheet is a narrow
        single sheet, or regular sheet folded
      </p>
      <p>
        in half, which is placed across the bed under the patient. It can assist
        with transfers, or be used as additional protection under the patient. A
        slide board allows the patient to move or slide between two surfaces.
        Sometimes a combination of equipment will make the transfer even easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        When repositioning in bed, adjust the height of the bed, if possible, to
        allow you to work at waist level, avoiding reaching, and bending. Keep
        the head of the bed flat, making it easy to move in that direction by
        avoiding the need to move “up hill.” If moving between two surfaces, be
        sure that both surfaces are at the same level and are flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Position the draw sheet or slide board under the patient’s trunk,
        centered for balance. If using a draw sheet, make a good handhold by
        rolling up the sheet as close to the patient’s body as possible. This
        prevents the sheet from forming a hammock, which would allow the patient
        to “hang” in the middle, putting more weight on the caregivers. Use a
        gentle push and pull motion to move the patient to new surface. If using
        a slide board, grasp it securely, count to three with your co-worker,
        and together slide the patient in the direction you want to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Transfers in Sitting Position:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This transfer is for patients who are unable to stand and must transfer
        in a sitting position. The patient must have good sitting balance and be
        able to cooperate when moving from one surface to another, such as from
        the bed to a wheelchair, or wheelchair to toilet seat. A transfer board
        or movable seat may be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Lower the bed appropriately to the height of the chair so both surfaces
        are at the same level. For a bed-to-wheelchair transfer, lock the wheels
        on the bed and the chair. Position the slide board as a bridge between
        the two surfaces and assist the patient onto one end of the board,
        making sure that the patient’s clothing is between the patient’s skin
        and the board. Assist the patient to slide onto the other surface, and
        then gently reposition the patient while removing the board from
        underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Using a Gait Belt:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A gait belt can assist patients who are partially dependent, have some
        weight-bearing ability, and are cooperative with transfer and
        ambulation. Do not use a belt for patients with recent abdominal or back
        surgery, or for patients with a history of abdominal aneurysm.
        Double-check your care plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Before beginning the activity, place the belt around the patient’s
        waist, making sure that clothing is completely under the belt. Fasten
        the belt snuggly, leaving just enough room to grasp the belt easily
        between the patient’s body and your fingers. Some belts include handles,
        which make it easier to grasp; without handles the caregiver simply
        grasps the belt itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell the patient in which direction you will be moving, always
        transferring to the patient’s strongest side if he or she is weaker on
        one side. Stand in front of the patient, bracing his or her feet with
        your own feet. Use good body mechanics. Rather than using the belt to
        lift the patient, rock and pull smoothly in the direction you with to
        go. Once the patient is standing, if using the belt to ambulate, stand
        next to the patient and hold the belt in the back. For additional
        stability, hold onto the patient’s hand that’s closest to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Always be alert to the possibility of the patient becoming weak and
        falling. If a patient starts to lose balance or fall while walking with
        the fait belt, continue to grasp the belt and lower the patient gently
        on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Bathtub, Shower, and Toileting Activities:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Special bathroom transfer equipment includes toilet seat risers, raised
        toilet seats, and grab bars. These may be used for toileting partially
        weight-bearing patients who can sit up unaided and who have the ability
        and strength to use their arms and hands. Patients must also be able to
        bend at the hips, knees, and angles. Sometimes, even patients who are
        very independent also use this equipment for added safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Raised toilet seats and risers decrease the distance and amount of
        effort it takes for the patient to lower himself to the toilet. Grab

      <p>Safety:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        As you’ve seen, any movement activity carries the risk of injury to the
        caregiver and/or the patient. Keeping yourself and your patient safe
        should always be your main concern. Follow the basic guidelines: good
        body mechanics, proper positioning of the patient and equipment, get
        help when needed, know how to use equipment, and follow the care plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Think ahead – prepare the environment before the activity. Always check
        the patient’s mental and physical status before any movement an allow
        recovery time between activities.

      <p>Infection Control:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Controlling infection includes keeping equipment clean and avoiding the
        spread of germs from one surface to another. Watch carefully for the
        possibility of soiled equipment, especially when using gait belts and
        draw sheets, which may soak up body fluids. Clean
      </p>
      <p>
        surfaces when they become soiled and remove laundry items from the
        patient-care area promptly.

      <p>Encouragement and Support:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, fear of injury places a patient at even greater risk. When a
        patient is afraid, they may hesitate, react more slowly, and hold the
        body stiffly to “prevent” injury. This may have just the opposite
        effect, making movement awkward and throwing you off balance. The
        patient might also cling to you, placing more weight on you than
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To promote a feeling of safety, always tell the patient exactly what you
        will be doing. Talk through the transfer before actually doing it.
        Maintain eye contact and give verbal cues and encouragement during the
        movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        After any activity, tell the patient how well he or she did. Point out
        things that went particularly well, noticing any areas of improvement.
        This encouragement can give the patient needed confidence for the next
        activity.

      <p>Reinforce Education:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Safety teaching is a big part of the home health care plan. Follow up on
        instructions that the nurse and/or therapist have given the patient.
        Remind the patient about safety hazards and actions to take. Look to see
        whether throw rugs and other obstructions have been removed from
        pathways.

      <p>Observation and Reporting:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Transfers and other movements may require a great deal of your patient’s
        energy. Watch for the patient’s reaction and tell your supervisor if the
        patient experiences any excessive weakness. If the patient reports
        feeling light-headed, ensure a safe position and check his blood
        pressure when it’s safe to do so. Report changes to your supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Share information about the patient’s activities during team
        conferences. Report any difficulties you may be having, and update the
        nurse and/or therapist about any problems with equipment, including a
        patient’s delay in purchasing equipment or its delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately report any falls or other accidents that you or the patient
        experience. Documentation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Documenting the number of activities, such as transfers, and the
        patient’s reaction, is important for care planning. The nurse and/or
        therapist need to know how the patient is progressing. Your
        documentation of the patient’s abilities, reactions and tolerance of the
        activity will be helpful when decisions are made to increase or change
        the types of movement a patient is allowed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, clearly document any falls or accidents; include only the
        facts of the occurrence, what you did to assist the patient, and who you
        notified.

        It is clear that your safe handling of patients, as well as the
        encouragement that you provide, can help your patients and your agency
        achieve good outcomes. Several outcomes link to transfers and movement.
        Your work with patients will affect any improvement that they may make
        in ambulation, bathing, transferring, and pain. Safety will play a part
        in avoiding a trip to the emergency room or admission to the hospital.
        And, independence in transfers is one step on the road to discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever the care plan calls for you to assist with transfers or other
        movement activities, think about the connection to good outcomes. Then
        ask yourself what you can do to make sure that happens. Remember the
        basic safety tips you’ve learned and put them into action whenever
        you’re involved in even the simplest movement with your patients.
