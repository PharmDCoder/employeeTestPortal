            Maintaining the safety of a patient’s home is one of the most
            important aspects of a home health aide’s job. Safety cannot be
            overlooked.

            According to the Home Safety Council, fires and burns are the third
            leading cause of unintentional home injury and related deaths.
            Additionally, cigarette smoking was determined to be a contributing
            factor in most home fires.

        <li>
          <p>Living alone</p>

            Fire safety and survival begin when everyone knows the basics.
            Therefore, one of the most important aspects of fire safety is
            having a fire extinguisher and knowing how to sue it. Home health
            aides should know whether a patient has a fire extinguisher and
            where it is located.

            Careless cooking is the number one cause of fires in the home.
            Thirty percent of all home fires start in the kitchen – more than
            any other room in the house. There are many ways to promote fire
            safety in the kitchen:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do not leave the stove unattended, especially when cooking at high
            temperatures
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Never pour water on a grease fire. Instead, turn off the stove and
            carefully cover the pan with a lid
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep pot handles pointing to the back of the stove.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do not wear clothing with long, loose-fitting sleeves while cooking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Never place or store pot-holders, towels, or other flammable items
            on or near the stove since they can easily ignite.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use the small burners for small pots and pans</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use insulated pot-holders for handling hot pots and pans</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Clean the stove regularly and wipe up spills as soon as possible
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there is a fire in the oven, keep the oven door closed and turn
            off heat
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep children and pets away from the cooking area</p>

            It is essential to educate patients who receive oxygen services
            about the dangers of open flames and oxygen. While oxygen itself is
            not flammable, it does act as an accelerant for an existing fire or
            even a spark. The oxygen tank should be stored in a clean, dry
            location away from direct sunlight, heat, and any source of open
            flame. Signs should be posted at the front door or window to advise
            firefighters of oxygen use in the home, as well as on the oxygen
            tank to remind others not to smoke nearby. If a caregiver or visitor
            must smoke, they should go outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the dangers of oxygen, any other medical equipment
            with an electrical circuit has the potential to cause a fire. For
            example, plugging an infusion pump into an overloaded circuit could
            lead to problems, so aides should report any potential hazards to a
            supervisor.

          <p>Smoke Detectors:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The home should be evaluated for the presence of functioning smoke
            detectors. It is recommended that one smoke detector be placed on
            every level of the home, and preferably, placed inside or near every
            bedroom. In addition, any smoke detector 10 years or older should be
            replaced.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Smoke detectors are inexpensive and are required by law in some
            communities. There are often community programs through which the
            local fire department or Rotary club donates smoke detectors or
            provides them at a lower cost to patients who can’t afford them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep a smoke detector in working order, take the following steps:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once a month, test each smoke detector</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once a year or when the detector “chirps,” replace the battery</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing impaired patients can also benefit from smoke detectors with
            special features such as flashing lights and/or vibrations.

          <p>Space Heaters:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Home fires are more common during the winter months, partly due to
            the increased use of free-standing heaters. Such heaters may be wood
            or coal burning stoves, or kerosene, gas, or electric heaters. Fires
            from these types of heaters often occur at night or at other times
            when the heaters are left unattended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heaters should be kept on level floors away from any flammable items
            or water. They should also be turned off at night or when the
            patient leaves the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Heaters also come with specific manufacturer’s instructions, which
            should be ready thoroughly.

          <p>Electrical Cords and Outlets:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            All switches should have cover plates with no wiring exposed. Faulty
            wiring, frayed electrical cords, unsafe holiday decorations,
            overloaded outlets, multiple extension cords connected together, and
            arcing in circuit boxes can cause electrical fires.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Electric blankets must be kept in good working order and either
            repaired or discarded if they malfunction. They should never be used
            on bedridden patients. Lamps and other lights should not be touching
            any fabrics such as bedspreads or drapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid tucking extension cords under rugs or looping over doorways to
            decrease a patient’s risk of tripping, because that may wear down a
            cord’s protective coating.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, curling irons, electric razors, and hair dryers should
            always be unplugged when not in use.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Careless management of cigarettes, lighters, and matches is a major
            contributing factor in house fires. The following are safety tips
            for patients or visitors who smoke:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not smoke in bed</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not smoke when tired or drowsy from medication</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not leave smoking materials un attended</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Always empty ashtrays into a metal container or toilet</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Some patients should only smoke while supervised</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Most cigarette fires start when ashes or cigarette butts drop on
            upholstered furniture or bedding. Garbage cans may catch on fire if
            cigarette butts are not completely out when ashtrays are emptied.
            Since young children are very attracted to lighters and matches,
            which can easily start fires, keep these items where only adults can
            reach them.

          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Decorative candles have become very popular, and candle fires have
            increased in the United States. Keep candles out of reach of
            children and pets, and away from curtains and furniture. They should
            not be left unattended even for a minute. Older people should not
            use candles unsupervised.

          <p>Escape Plan:</p>
          <p>
            One of the most important aspects of a home fire safety assessment
            is the escape route or plan to follow in the case of a fire. Many
            homecare agencies assist the patient in developing an escape plan,
            so follow any specific agency policies or procedures. Home health
            aides should to the following:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Review the plan regularly with patients and other caregivers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Find two exits out of every room</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Determine how many possible escape routes exist</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consider whether there are multiple floors</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the distance and direction to the nearest stairwell or fire
            escape (keep in mind elevators cannot be used during fires)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Know how to remove safety bars in order to open windows</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the patient’s physical or mental limitations Carbon
            Monoxide Poisoning:
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is poisonous
            to humans and pets. Defective furnaces, fireplace flues, oil
            heaters, and appliances have long been the primary cause of
            accidental CO poisoning. There are no obvious symptoms if an
            individual’s CO levels are less than 10 percent. Most people are
            unaware that they have been exposed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            At low levels, symptoms often mimic the flu or a cold, and may
            include these:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Headache</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fatigue</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Mild confusion</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Irregular breathing and heartbeat</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Nausea</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Coughing</p>

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Furnaces and gas appliances should be inspected by a qualified
            contractor once a year before the start of the winter heating
            months. In addition to professional annual check- ups, furnaces
            should be checked periodically to assess the following:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Flames should be mostly blue and steady</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Look for discoloration or soot build-up around the burner access
            door and vents
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check the venting system. Soft, rusted, or broken vent piping can
            release CO
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examine the furnace or boiler. It should be free of dust, rust, or
            any other signs of corrosion
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check air filters regularly, and clean or replace them as needed
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make sure furnace panels and grills are in place and that the fan
            compartment door is closed when the furnace is on. Leaving these
            doors open could cause CO build-up in living areas
          </p>

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            CO detectors should be installed on each level of the home, and in
            or near each bedroom. Many advanced smoke detectors also monitor CO
            levels. CO detectors can be tested by using special pellets that
            simulate CO. When the pellet is moistened, it releases a non-
          </p>
          <p>
            toxic gas. After a few minutes, if the detector is working properly,
            the alarm should sound.

          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most obvious aspects of home safety is keeping the
            environment safe for patients at risk for falls. Falling is a very
            serious health risk—and the leading cause of injury deaths – among
            older adults. One in three adults over the age of 65 falls each
            year, and more than half of them will fall again. More than 80
            percent of fractures among older people are caused by falls.

            The unfortunate fact is that a large percentage of homecare patients
            are at an increased risk of falls. Below are factors that increase a
            person’s risk of falling. Having several factors further increases a
            patient’s risk.

            Hazards in the home increase the risk of falling. More than half of
            those who fall do so in their own homes due to the following problem
            areas.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Floors: Cluttered arrangement of furniture, loose throw rugs, and
            objects on the floor such as papers, magazines, books, electrical
            wires, and even pets

            While it is true that a nurse or therapist should check the home for
            these hazards, it is often the home health aide who recognizes the
            dangers in the home. It is important for aides to assist patients in
            reducing these hazards as soon as they are discovered.

          <p>
            Whether your patient lives in a house, a condominium, or an
            apartment, a break-in can permanently shatter the feeling of
            security at home. According to the Federal Bureau of
          </p>
          <p>
            Investigations (FBI) statistics, a house, apartment, or condominium
            is burglarized every 15 seconds. Fortunately, burglary is probably
            the most preventable crime. By taking a few simple precautions, you
            can dramatically help your patients reduce the risks.
          </p>

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Homecare patients are vulnerable to burglary since they are often
            elderly and in poor health. Therefore, it is important to know how
            to keep a home safe from burglary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Most burglars look for something worth stealing, easy access
            combined with low visibility, and unoccupied homes.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>Make the Home a Harder Target:</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Recommend that the patients secure exterior doors and any doors from
            attached garages by installing good quality deadbolt locks,
            security-type door strikes, and strong, properly installed doors and
            door frames that cannot be spread apart. In addition, secure windows
            with additional locks and impact-resistant glass, if possible.
          </p>

            <br />

            Pruning lower branches of trees near the home is a good way to keep
            burglars from gaining access to a second story window, in addition
            to eliminating potential hiding places. Installing motion detector
            lights around the house – at least eight feet about the ground so
            they are more difficult to disable – is a good way to attract
            attention of neighbors and others to movement.

          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, installing an alarm system with a loud sire and/or
            flashing lights will attract the neighbors’ attention. If a patient
            has an alarm system, make sure the decals are displayed prominently,
            and that the system is tested regularly.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Always lock all doors when you leave a patient’s home. Recommend

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Advise patients to avoid letting strangers into their homes unless
            they are expected, as in the case of a service appointment
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make sure patients provide keys only to trusted family members. Keys
            should never be left under doormats or with service people
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Advise patients to keep valuables out of view from a window. If

      <p>
        As a home health aide, you spend more time in patients’ homes than other
        caregivers, and you may also cook light meals during visits. Therefore,
        you must pay careful attention to fire safety in the home, be alert to
        problem areas, and report them to your supervisor.

      <p>Encouragement:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting the patient to comply with safety measures in the home can be a
        challenge. Although homecare staff must perform assessments in the
        patient’s home, it is ultimately up to the patient or family to put into
        action any recommended suggestions. Remind patients that they play an
        important role in their own recovery, and that the amount of advice they
        can accept will affect their rate of recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Observation and Reporting:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Conduct a casual home evaluation each time you enter the home since the
        environment can change during the course of treatment. As the seasons
        change, for example, the fact that the patient uses a space heater may
        become a problem. This may be new information that isn’t contained in
        the initial home safety evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Take note especially if everyone in the home is experiencing at least
        some of the symptoms of CO poisoning, and pay particular attention if
        pets exhibit symptoms since animals cannot get the flu. At levels
        greater than 20 percent, a person can lose consciousness, go into a
        coma, or die. If CO poisoning is suspected, you much follow
      </p>
      <p>
        agency procedure on how to respond. Most procedures include evacuation
        and getting the patient to fresh air immediately. You should call 911
        from another location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Always note and report problems to your supervisor, especially when the
        patient cannot or will not correct the problem. Also, discuss issues or
        concerns you may have, such as evacuation a patient without assistance.

        A patient’s home environment and safety level directly affect outcomes
        for your patients. Keeping the home safe will help improve key outcomes
        for your patients. A home environment that is safe for the patient will
        reduce falls, allow the patient to transfer and walk effectively during
        recovery, and keep the patient out of the hospital.
