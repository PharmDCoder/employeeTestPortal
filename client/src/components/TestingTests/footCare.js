            Today, foot problems are a huge public health risk, costing the U.S.
            $3.5 billion annually. Daily foot care helps prevent most of these
            foot problems; however, fashion trends and lack of foot care
            knowledge often prevail. More than 43.1 million Americans – one in
            every six people – have trouble with their feet, mostly from
            improperly fitting shoes. This includes 11 million seniors with foot
            problems, or one out of three people age 65 or older.

          <p>
            While only a small percentage of the population is born with foot
            problems, three out of four Americans experience serious foot
            problems during their lifetime, and nearly 5 percent have toenail
            problems. Problems not only occur from wearing ill-fitting shoes,
            but also by exposure to water, dry air, excessive heat or cold, and
            friction. Other foot problems include poor circulation, arthritis,
            diabetes, spurs, and ingrown toenails.

            Some say a person’s foot health mirrors their general health.
            Conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, and nerve and circulatory
            disorders can initially appear in the feet. Therefore, foot ailments
            can be the first sign or more serious medical problems. This is one
            of the reason physicians assess patients’ feet during physical
            exams.

            Arthritis:
            <span class="p">
              Arthritis is a disease characterized by the inflammation of the
              cartilage and lining of the body’s joints. Movement becomes very
              difficult and painful. The pain and swelling worsens while
              standing or walking, and stiffness usually occurs after periods of
              rest. Inflammation can cause redness, warmth, pain and swelling.

          <p>
            About 40 million Americans suffer from arthritis, with most cases
            affecting the feet. The National Institute of Arthritis and
            Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, estimates that by the year 2020,
            about 60 million Americans will have arthritis. Arthritis is a
            common cause of foot pain in people over the age of 50.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common of these conditions is osteoarthritis, which is the
            simple deterioration of cartilage in the joints. Age, excessive
            weight, ill-fitting shoes, and injury are the basic causes of
            osteoarthritis.

              A bunion appears when the joints in the big toe no longer fit

              Calluses are a build-up of dead skin. These occur more frequently
              and build up faster in people with poor circulation due to the
              high-pressure areas under the foot. If not properly trimmed,
              calluses can get very thick, break down, and turn into ulcers or
              open sores.

              cells usually on the top, side, or tip of the toe. The cone-shaped
              core forms a point that can press on a nerve below, causing pain.
              Corns can become inflamed due to constant friction and pressure
              from improper footwear. Corns that are located between the toes
              are usually soft due to perspiration in the forefoot area. If gone
              untreated, corns can result in bursitis and ulcers.

              Fungal infections, such as athlete’s foot, occur when feet spend
              too much time in shoes – warm, dark, humid places perfect for
              fungus growth. Fungal conditions cause dry skin, redness,
              blistering, itching, and peeling, and make is difficult to walk or
              wear shoes.

            Fungus can spread to toenails and other body parts that people touch
            after scratching their feet. If not treated immediately, this
            infection can be hard to cure. It also spreads easily when sharing
            shoes or personal care items, such as towels and washcloths.

            These infections may make a person more susceptible to various
            infections. Those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes,
            circulatory problems, or immune deficiency conditions, are
            especially prone to fungal toenail infections. Signs of infection
            include nails turning yellow or brown, getting thicker, having a bad
            odor, and collecting debris underneath.

              {" "}
              Hell fissures, also known as cracked heels can seem like a simple
              cosmetic problem, but they can also lead to serious medical
              problems. Heel fissures occur when the skin on the outer edge of
              the heel becomes dry, hard, and flaky. When this happens, small
              cracks become deep and painful.

            Heel fissures can affect anyone, but risk factors include obesity,
            walking barefoot, wearing sandals or open-backed shoes, having
            inactive sweat glands, and living in dry climates. Like many foot
            conditions, heel fissures become more dangerous if they go untreated
            and become deep or infected. This condition is especially dangerous
            for people with poor circulation.

              Ingrown toenails are often associated with other toe infections,
              and develop for many reasons. In some cases, the condition is
              congenital, meaning the person was born with nails that become
              ingrown frequently. However, trauma from stubbing a toe or having
              a toe stepped on can cause an ingrown toenail.

            The most common cause of ingrown toenails is improper cutting, which
            allows nails to
          </p>
          <p>
            re-grow into the skin. An ingrown nail occurs when a corner or side
            of the nail grows into the skin. Tight hosiery or shoes also
            contribute to ingrown nails. There may be an infection if the skin
            is red, painful, or swollen around the nail. When the nail
            penetrates the skin in a warm, moist, bacteria-rich environment, it
            provides a convenient entry for germs that can cause infection. If
            left untreated, the nail continues into the skin, causing a more
            severe infection.

            Patients with a history of foot problems should see their physician
            at least every three to six months, since they are at high risk for
            recurring foot problems. If patients have poor circulation, they
            should tell their physician so he or she can consider this
            information when prescribing medication for high blood pressure or
            heart disease. Physicians may also advise patients to avoid or
            engage in certain exercises to promote foot health.

          <p>
            Years of wear and tear can be hard on our feet, and injuries can
            create further problems. As people age, their skin becomes thinner,
            loses some of its elastic quality, is less capable of protecting
            itself from damage, and heals more slowly from cuts or burns. Many
            elderly have trouble with ambulation. Therefore, foot care is
            necessary to prevent foot problems. Proper foot care helps the
            homebound patient maintain healthy feet, walk properly, avoid falls
            and foot injuries, and function at the highest possible level.

          <p>
            When you care for a patient that requires foot care, it is important
            to know several key factors that help prevent foot problems. Avoid
            using harsh soaps, bubble bath, or shower gels that strip the skin
            of its natural oils. Instead use moisturizing soaps and lotions to
            keep your patient’s feet healthy. Elderly patients may also have
            prescription products,
          </p>
          <p>
            which are listed on the patient’s care plan. Ask your patient which
            products he or she likes to use.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            As a home health aide, you probably visit patients more often than
            other homecare team members do. Therefore, it is important that you
            always look at a patient’s feet and closely follow the care plan.
            Since many diseases first appear in the feet before appearing in
            other parts of the body, always report unusual findings to your
            supervisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect of foot care is observing the feet and skin. Does the
            skin look healthy? If not, what is different? Do the color,
            temperature, and size of each foot look right? When comparing one
            foot to the other, are there any significant differences? Remember
            that it is not uncommon for one foot to be larger than the other,
            but swelling in only one foot is significant. Daily observation and
            reporting abnormal findings benefit the homecare patient and assist
            in early detection of medical condition, such as poor circulation,
            diabetes, or arthritis.

            When you note abnormalities while observing the feet, you must
            report those findings to the patient’s case manager, according to
            agency policies. Findings to report include the following:

            One of the best ways patients can prevent common foot problems is by
            wearing appropriate socks. The best socks are made of absorbent
            material – either cotton or blends that wick away sweat and
            moisture. Wicking is important since sweat softens skin and makes it
            more prone to blisters and tears. White socks are better than
            colored socks since dyes and harsh chemicals from colors may bleed
            onto sweaty feet and cause skin damage.

          </p>
          <p>
            Help the patient select socks that fit correctly, are free of areas
            that may cause pressure on the skin, and pull sweat away from the
            skin. Check the patient’s socks to make sure they are clean, free of
            lint, and seamless to help prevent blisters and sores.

          <p>
            The right socks won’t matter unless a patient wears the right shoes.
            Never select heels, clogs, flip flops, or other inappropriate or
            unsafe shoes. Look at the patient’s shoe collection and determine
            which ones are right for the patient’s foot. Consider the following:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the size and shape of the patient’s foot? Remember that feet
            change as a person ages, so old shoes may no longer fit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Compare the shape of the patient’s food with the shape of the shoes.
            Are they both short, wide, long, or slender?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check both feet. Are they the same size? Most people have one foot
            that is slightly larger than the other, so check both feet and
            choose shoes that fit the larger foot.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The biggest mistake patients make is purchasing a pair of shoes
            based on size alone without considering the width of their feet,
            variations in manufactures, and the changes in foot size over the
            years.

          <p>
            Keep the patient’s feet healthy and promote comfort by washing the
            patient’s feet with warm water and a sponge or washcloth. Test the
            water temperature with your elbow to ensure it is not too hot. Wet
            the patient’s feet, apply moisturizing soap, and apply mild friction
            to clean the feet. Remember that elderly skin is very fragile, so be
            gentle. Clean carefully between the toes and finish by rinsing the
            foot with warm water.

            Dry the foot carefully especially between the toes. Apply lotion to
            the foot and gently rub into the skin. Do not put lotion between the
            toes, as this might cause infection.

            sides. After cutting, the nail should be smooth without jagged areas
            that can cause injury to skin. Be very careful not to cut or scratch
            the cuticles.

            are comfortable; if not, select another pair.
